The reason for this is that an active ingredient in the product could interact with — increase or lessen — the effect of other medicines you’re taking. People undergoing treatment for cancer should not receive any dietary supplements unless they’re prescribed by a doctor or given as part of a clinical trial that’s received Institutional Review Board approval. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not evaluate the safety and labeling of dietary supplements before they are sold. Also, the clinical effects of these products are often difficult to predict due to lack of human data. The potencies of herbal supplements are influenced by plants or plant parts used, harvesting and processing methods, and the amounts of active compounds absorbed.

Print Email Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is any medical and health care systems, practices, or products that are not thought of as standard medical care. Standard treatments are based on scientific evidence from research studies. Complementary medicine refers to treatments that are used with standard medical treatments, like using acupuncture to help with side effects of cancer treatment. Alternative medicine refers to treatments that are used instead of standard medical treatments. Integrative medicine is a total approach to care that combines standard medical treatment with the CAM practices that have been shown to be safe and effective. Although claims made by CAM treatment providers about the benefits of the treatments can sound promising, we do not know how safe many CAM treatments are or how well they work. If you are using or considering using a complementary or alternative therapy, you should talk with your doctor or nurse. Some CAM therapies may interfere with standard treatment or even be harmful.

    "content": "Heart Healthy Mediterranean Diet May Cut Breast Cancer Risk - American Institute for Cancer Research % For years, we’ve heard a lot about the heart health benefits of the Mediterranean Diet. Now an analysis from a randomized trial suggests this diet, supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and nuts, may help lower risk of breast cancer. The analysis, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , is from the PREDIMED trial – a 6 year study that includes data from over 4000 women, 60-80 years old and at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The women had been assigned to follow one of three diets, a Mediterranean diet where they received extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet with provided mixed nuts, or they were advised to follow a low fat diet. The women had quarterly sessions with a dietitian to assess how well they were following the diet. At the end of the study, the women following the Mediterranean diet with olive oil showed a 62% lower risk of malignant breast cancer than the control, low fat diet group. When researchers put the olive oil and nuts groups together, there was a 51% relative risk reduction compared to the control group. A Mediterranean diet plate contains plenty of legumes, nuts, grains, vegetables and fruits with olive oil providing most fat. This traditional diet from Greece and southern Italy also includes fish, moderate amounts of poultry and dairy, just small amounts of red and processed meats and moderate alcohol with meals. Eating a diet with mostly plant foods is linked with lower cancer risk and is one of AICR’s recommendations for cancer prevention . In this study the addition of extra virgin olive oil may contribute to lower cancer risk, the authors say, due to some of olive oil’s active compounds like polyphenols or oleic acid. The authors’ caution that this a secondary analysis – the primary purpose of PREDIMED was to study the Mediterranean diet’s effect on cardiovascular disease. In addition the number of breast cancer cases was small — 35 women — and because the women were at high risk for cardiovascular disease, these results may not apply to all women. In the meantime, we know there are evidence-based steps women can take to lower risk of postmenopausal breast cancer: stay a healthy weight, be physically active at least 30 minutes every day and don’t drink alcohol. And there are lots of reasons to follow a diet with plenty of plant foods, including to help you get to and stay a healthy weight. Learn how to do that with our free online New American Plate Challenge . We’re only in week two – ten more weeks to go – so you can still sign up! The PREDIMED study was funded by the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, the official funding agency for Biomedical Research of the Spanish Government. The supplemental foods used in the study were donated by Patrimonio Comunal Olivarero and Hojiblanca, Spain (EVOO); the California Walnut Commission, Sacramento, California (walnuts); and Borges SA (almonds) and La Morella Nuts (hazelnuts), both from Reus, Spain. Study authors have also received research funding from these groups.

Print Email Medicinal Mushrooms (PDQ®)–Patient Version Introduction Go to Health Professional Version Medicinal mushrooms are mushrooms that are used as medicine . They have been used to treat infection for hundreds of years, mostly in Asia. Today, medicinal mushrooms are also used to treat lung diseases and cancer . For more than 30 years, medicinal mushrooms have been approved as an addition to standard cancer treatments in Japan and China. In these countries, mushrooms have been used safely for a long time, either alone or combined with radiation or chemotherapy . In Asia, there are more than 100 types of mushrooms used to treat cancer. Some of the more common ones are Ganoderma lucidum (reishi), Trametes versicolor or Coriolus versicolor (turkey tail), Lentinus edodes (shiitake), and Grifola frondosa (maitake). Mushrooms are being studied to find out how they affect the immune system and if they stop or slow the growth of tumors or kill tumor cells . It is thought that certain chemical compounds , such as polysaccharides ( beta-glucans ) in turkey tail mushrooms, strengthen the immune system to fight cancer. This summary gives an overview of the use of medicinal mushrooms in treating cancer. The following information is given for Trametes versicolor , also called Coriolus versicolor (turkey tail), and Ganoderma lucidum (reishi): How it is given or taken. Reviews of laboratory and animal studies . Results of clinical trials (studies in humans). Side effects . U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) information. Questions and Answers About Turkey Tail and Polysaccharide-K (PSK) What is turkey tail? Turkey tail is a type of mushroom that grows on dead logs worldwide. It's named turkey tail because its rings of brown and tan look like the tail feathers of a turkey. Its scientific name is Trametes versicolor or Coriolus versicolor . In traditional Chinese medicine , it is known as Yun Zhi. In Japan, it is known as kawaratake (roof tile fungus ). There are many other types of Trametes mushrooms. It can be hard to tell the difference between turkey tail and other types of Trametes mushrooms without the use of special testing. Turkey tail has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat lung diseases for many years. In Japan, turkey tail has been used to strengthen the immune system when given with standard cancer treatment. What is PSK? Polysaccharide K (PSK) is the best known active compound in turkey tail mushrooms. In Japan, PSK is an approved mushroom product used to treat cancer. How is PSK given or taken? PSK can be taken as a tea or in capsule form. Have any laboratory or animal studies been done using PSK? In laboratory studies , tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies , tests are done to see if a drug , procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of PSK on the immune system, including immune cells called natural killer cells and T-cells . For more information on laboratory and animal studies done using PSK, see the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Medicinal Mushrooms. Have any studies of PSK been done in people? PSK has been studied in patients with gastric cancer , breast cancer , colorectal cancer , and lung cancer . It has been used as adjuvant therapy in thousands of cancer patients since the mid-1970s. PSK has been safely used in people for a long time in Japan and few side effects have been reported. Gastric cancer Studies show that the use of PSK as adjuvant therapy in patients with gastric (stomach) cancer may help repair immune cell damage caused by chemotherapy and strengthen the immune system. Studies of PSK as adjuvant therapy for gastric cancer include the following: A randomized clinical trial in Japan done between 1978 and 1981 included 751 patients who had surgery for gastric cancer. After surgery, patients received chemotherapy with or without PSK. On average, the patients who received chemotherapy and PSK lived longer than those who received chemotherapy alone. The researchers believe it might be possible to predict which patients would benefit the most from PSK depending on the numbers of granulocytes and lymphocytes in the patient’s blood . In 1994, a study in Japan followed 262 patients who had successful surgery for gastric cancer and were given chemotherapy with or without PSK. Patients who received chemotherapy and PSK were less likely to have recurrent cancer and lived longer than those who did not. Treatment with PSK caused few side effects. The researchers thought the study showed that PSK and chemotherapy should be given to gastric cancer patients after surgery to remove the cancer. A review published in 2007 combined results from 8 randomized controlled trials in 8,009 patients who had surgery to remove gastric cancers. After surgery, patients in the trials were given chemotherapy with or without PSK. The results suggest that receiving chemotherapy and PSK helped patients live longer after surgery. Breast cancer To date, PSK studies in patients with breast cancer have focused on changes in the immune system (T-cell and B-cell levels in the blood) rather than on clinical results (patient survival, symptoms , side effects, and quality of life ). Colorectal cancer Studies of PSK as adjuvant therapy for colorectal cancer include the following: PSK was studied in a randomized clinical trial for its effect on the immune system in patients with stage II or stage III rectal cancer . Patients received chemotherapy and radiation therapy, with or without PSK. This study found that PSK increased the number of cancer-killing immune cells and had anticancer effects in tissue that received radiation therapy. A review that combined results from 3 studies in 1,094 patients with colorectal cancer found that patients who received PSK were less likely to have recurrent cancer and lived longer than those who did not. Two groups from Japan studied patients with colorectal cancer who received adjuvant chemotherapy with or without PSK after surgery. In the first study, patients who were treated with both chemotherapy and PSK had markedly better 10-year survival rates. In the second study of patients who were older than 70 years, 3-year survival rates were markedly higher in the group treated with both chemotherapy and PSK. Lung cancer Studies of PSK as adjuvant therapy for patients with lung cancer include the following: Five nonrandomized clinical trials reported that patients treated with PSK and radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy lived longer. Six randomized clinical trials in patients with lung cancer studied chemotherapy with or without PSK. The studies showed that patients who received PSK improved in one or more ways, including immune function , body weight, well-being, tumor-related symptoms, or longer survival. Have any side effects or risks been reported from turkey tail or PSK? There have been few side effects reported in studies of PSK in Japan. Is turkey tail or PSK approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The FDA has not approved the use of turkey tail or its active compound PSK as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition . The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of mushroom supplements may not be the same. Questions and Answers About Reishi What is reishi? Reishi is a type of mushroom that grows on live trees. Scientists may call it either Ganoderma lucidum or Ganoderma sinense . In traditional Chinese medicine , this group of mushrooms is known as Ling Zhi. In Japan, they are known as Reishi. In China, G. lucidum is known as Chizhi and G. sinense is known as Zizhi. There are many other types of Ganoderma mushrooms and it is hard to tell the medicinal mushrooms from the other types. Reishi has been used as medicine for a very long time in East Asia. It was thought to prolong life, prevent aging, and increase energy. In China, it is being used to strengthen the immune system of cancer patients who receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy . How is reishi given or taken? Reishi is usually dried and taken as an extract in the form of a liquid, capsule , or powder. Have any laboratory or animal studies been conducted using reishi? In laboratory studies , tumor cells are used to test a new substance and find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies , tests are done to see if a drug , procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of the active ingredients in reishi mushrooms, triterpenoids and polysaccharides , on tumors, including lung cancer . For information on laboratory and animal studies done using reishi, see the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Medicinal Mushrooms. Have any studies of reishi mushrooms been done in people? Studies using products made from reishi have been done in China and Japan. Lung cancer Studies suggest that the use of products made from reishi as adjuvant therapy may help strengthen the immune system in patients with lung cancer. Studies in patients with lung cancer include the following: In an open-label trial done in China, 36 patients with advanced lung cancer were given an over-the-counter product made from reishi called Ganopoly. The patients were being treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy, along with other complementary therapies. Some patients had marked changes in the immune responses being studied, such as lymphocyte count and natural killer cell activity, and some patients had no change in immune response. In China, a study was done with 12 lung cancer patients. Their blood was tested to see if taking a product made from reishi could help improve immune response. The study found that the polysaccharides in reishi mushrooms may help cancer-fighting immune cells, called lymphocytes, stay active. Colorectal cancer The following study looked at reishi for the prevention of colorectal cancer: In Japan, 225 patients with benign colorectal tumors were studied. For 12 months, 123 of the patients were given an extract of the mushroom G. lucidum mycelia (MAK), while 102 patients did not receive treatment with MAK. At 12 months, a follow-up colonoscopy was done on all the patients. The number and the size of the tumors decreased in the group that received MAK, but not in the group that did not receive MAK. The researchers suggest that MAK may help stop benign colorectal tumors from forming. Is reishi approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The FDA has not approved the use of reishi as a treatment for cancer or any other medical condition . The FDA regulates dietary supplements separately from foods, cosmetics, and drugs. The FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices require that every finished batch of supplements is safe and that the claims on the label are true and do not mislead the consumer. However, the FDA does not regularly review the way that supplements are made, so all batches and brands of mushroom supplements may not be the same. About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish . PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of medicinal mushrooms in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board . Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website . For more information, call the Cancer Information Service (CIS), NCI's contact center, at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237). Permission to Use This Summary PDQ is a registered trademark.

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM Therapies It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected? What are the risks related to this therapy? What benefits can be expected from this therapy? Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? Will the therapy be covered by health insurance? To Learn More About CAM National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public. CAM on PubMed NCCIH and the NIH National Library of Medicine (NLM) jointly developed CAM on PubMed , a free and easy-to-use search tool for finding CAM-related journal citations. As a subset of the NLM's PubMed bibliographic database, CAM on PubMed features more than 230,000 references and abstracts for CAM-related articles from scientific journals. This database also provides links to the websites of over 1,800 journals, allowing users to view full-text articles. (A subscription or other fee may be required to access full-text articles.) Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine The NCI Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) coordinates the activities of the NCI in the area of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). OCCAM supports CAM cancer research and provides information about cancer-related CAM to health providers and the general public via the NCI website .

    "content": "Does soy really affect breast cancer risk? - Mayo Clinic This content does not have an English version. This content does not have an Arabic version. Skip to content Appointments at Mayo Clinic Mayo Clinic offers appointments in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota and at Mayo Clinic Health System locations. Request Appointment Products and services Will eating soy increase my risk of breast cancer? No. Eating soybeans or food that contains soy will not raise a person's risk of breast cancer. Looking across populations, research finds that eating foods with soy may lower the risk of breast cancer. But it isn't clear whether soy supplements are safe for people who've had breast cancer or who are at high risk of breast cancer. Long-term contact with the hormone estrogen is a risk factor for breast cancer. Soybeans contain plant chemicals called isoflavones. When digested by some people, some isoflavones act a little like estrogen that's made in the body. But plant estrogens in food are weaker than estrogen made in the body. And isoflavones may help lower the effect of estrogens made by the body. In some people, the action of isoflavones may block the body's estrogen in some tissues. In other tissues, isoflavones may act as a weakened form of estrogen. Breast cancer risk from estrogen is linked to lifelong exposure: Getting your period, also called menstruation, at a younger age than typical. Late start of menopause. No pregnancies or first pregnancy at an older age. Hormone therapy history with estrogen and progestin. Other factors that raise the risk of breast cancer are: Age. A family history of breast cancer or genetic changes that make cancer more likely. Alcohol use. Dense breast tissue. Obesity after menopause. Breast or chest contact with radiation. If you have questions about your risk of breast cancer, talk with a healthcare professional. Soybeans and foods with soy can be part of a healthy eating pattern. Soy milk and yogurt, with added vitamins and calcium, are nutritionally similar to dairy milk and yogurt. And there are about 56 to 83 milligrams of isoflavones in 1 cup (240 milliliters) of soy milk. Get the latest breast cancer information from Mayo Clinic delivered to your inbox.

Print Email Cancer is not one disease, but a collection of related diseases that can occur almost anywhere in the body. At its most basic, cancer is a disease of the genes in the cells of our body. Genes control the way our cells work. But, changes to these genes can cause cells to malfunction, causing them to grow and divide when they should not—or preventing them from dying when they should. These abnormal cells can become cancer. Understanding how genetic changes cause cancer is one way to understand this disease, while cancer statistics is another. Cancer statistics help scientists understand the burden of cancer on society. Statistics can tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year and the number of people who are living after a cancer diagnosis. Changes in statistics over time can help scientists find areas where progress is needed. Cancer statistics also help scientists understand cancer health disparities. Examples of disparities include the higher cancer death rates, less frequent use of proven screening tests, and higher rates of advanced cancer diagnoses that are found in certain groups of people.

Credit: Wikimedia Commons, CC BY-SA 2.0 Cancer is caused by changes to certain genes that alter the way our cells function. Some of these genetic changes occur naturally when DNA is replicated during the process of cell division. But others are the result of environmental exposures that damage DNA. These exposures may include substances, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke, or radiation, such as ultraviolet rays from the sun. People can avoid some cancer-causing exposures, such as tobacco smoke and the sun’s rays. But other ones are harder to avoid, especially if they are in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food we eat, or the materials we use to do our jobs. Scientists are studying which exposures may cause or contribute to the development of cancer. Understanding which exposures are harmful, and where they are found, may help people to avoid them. The National Toxicology Program (NTP) has identified the chemical substances listed below as known human carcinogens in the NTP's 15th Report on Carcinogens . Simply because a substance has been designated as a carcinogen, however, does not mean that the substance will necessarily cause cancer. Many factors influence whether a person exposed to a carcinogen will develop cancer, including the amount and duration of the exposure and the individual’s genetic background.

February 9, 2024 Cancer Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. Cancer is a leading cause of chronic illness and death in United States. The cause of many cancer types is unknown. It is likely determined by many factors, such as lifestyle choices, genetics, and exposure to radiation, chemicals, and environmental pollutants. We Track That Through data collection and monitoring, scientists have observed a relationship between some cancers and the presence of certain environmental pollutants. The Tracking Network has data for eighteen types of cancer. These cancer types are potentially linked with suspected environmental risk factors. The cancer data found on the Tracking Network come from two sources: CDC and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). National Program of Cancer Registries (CDC) Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Program (NCI) Types of Data The Tracking Network provides data on twenty cancer indicators . For each cancer indicator, you can view the following measures. Annual Age-adjusted Incidence Rate per 100,000 Population A Annual Number of Cases Average Annual Number of Cases Depending on the type of cancer and the year, data are available for most states. Measures may use combinations of the following geographic boundaries and time periods. Census tract, 10-year period 5,000 minimum person population area, 5-year period 20,000 minimum person population area, 5- or 3-year period County, 10- or 5-year period State, 10-, 5- or 1-year period Under advanced options, cancer data can be further refined by sex and race/ethnicity. The Tracking Network has data on the following types of cancer. Acute Myeloid Leukemia Bladder Cancer Brain and Other Nervous System Cancer Breast Cancer (Females only) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Colorectal Cancer Esophageal Cancer Kidney Cancer Larynx Cancer Leukemia Liver Cancer Lung and Bronchus Cancers Melanoma Mesothelioma Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Oral Cancer Pancreatic Cancer Prostate Cancer (Males only) Testicular Cancer (Males only) Thyroid Cancer Learn more about cancer. Access the Data Use the Data Explorer to create custom maps, tables, and charts. View data in simple Quick Reports . Get machine-readable data from the Application Program Interface (API) . Data in Action The Tracking Network is making cancer incidence data easier to use. We do this by integrating the information with other health outcome data and environmental data. Tracking can add to existing public health surveillance of cancer by examining potential ecological relationships with environmental exposures. Environmental pollution has been a source of great public concern for decades. But more research is needed about environmental exposures at the community level. Evidence is building to support a link between cancer and lower levels of exposures to environmental pollutants. Tracking cancer in a standard way over time can help us: Understand the distribution of cancer by place and time. Understand the cancer burden for a specific geographical area, and by population subgroup. Further develop linkage studies to evaluate environmental impacts on cancer. Direct prevention interventions and activities to specific populations and communities. Help allocate resources and services for affected populations.

Overview CDC supports screening for breast, cervical, colorectal (colon), and lung cancers as recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Screening means checking your body for cancer before you have symptoms. Getting screening tests regularly may find breast, cervical, colorectal (colon), and lung cancers early, when treatment is likely to work best. Cancer Doesn't Wait Audio Description Low Resolution Video In this video, Dr. Lisa Richardson, Dr. Robert W. Carlson, and Dr. Laura Makaroff talk about the importance of routine cancer screenings. Breast cancer For many women, mammograms are the best way to find breast cancer early, when it is easier to treat. Mammograms can find cancer before it is big enough to feel or cause symptoms. Learn more about screening for breast cancer. Cervical cancer The HPV test and the Pap test can help prevent cervical cancer or find it early. The HPV test looks for the virus ( human papillomavirus ) that can cause cell changes on the cervix. The Pap test (or Pap smear) looks for precancers, cell changes on the cervix that might become cervical cancer if they are not treated appropriately. Learn more about screening for cervical cancer. Colorectal (colon) cancer Colorectal cancer almost always develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Screening tests can find precancerous polyps, so they can be removed before they turn into cancer. Screening tests also can find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best. Learn more about screening for colorectal cancer. Lung cancer The USPSTF recommends yearly lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for people who: Have a history of heavy smoking, and Smoke now or quit within the past 15 years, and Are between 50 and 80 years old. Learn more about screening for lung cancer. Other types of cancer Screening for ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, testicular, and thyroid cancers has not been shown to reduce deaths from those cancers. The USPSTF found too little evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening people without symptoms for bladder cancer, oral cancer, and skin cancer.

Where can I get more information? When is asbestos a hazard? Back to top Asbestos is a hazard to health when the fibers are disturbed and become airborne. This means that asbestos poses health risks only when fibres are present in the air and then people breathe them into the lungs. Fibres can be released into the air when asbestos-containing products break down. This release can happen through deterioration or when the material is cut or disturbed. What is covered in this document? Back to top This document is part of a series of documents on asbestos: Asbestos - What is... Asbestos - Health Effects Asbestos - Control Strategies for Workplaces Asbestos - In the Home What should I do if I think there is asbestos in my house? Back to top Health Canada provides the following recommendations for homeowners who may have asbestos in their house: \"You can reduce your risk of exposure by hiring a professional to test for asbestos before doing any: renovations or remodelling demolitions additions If asbestos is found, hire a qualified asbestos removal specialist to get rid of it before beginning work. Avoid disturbing asbestos materials yourself. This increases the risk to your health and your family's health. Check with your provincial and territorial workplace safety authorities to find out the qualifications or certifications needed in your area. If you have vermiculite-based insulation in your attic, it may contain asbestos. To avoid exposure to asbestos fibres, do not disturb vermiculite-based attic insulation in any way or attempt to remove it yourself. Make sure: children are not allowed in the attic the attic is not used for storage or any other use professionals that are trained to handle asbestos are hired if you plan to remodel or renovate all cracks and holes in the ceiling of the rooms below the insulation are sealed caulking around light fixtures and the attic hatch is applied to prevent insulation from falling through If you have vermiculite-based insulation in your attic, some may have fallen inside your walls over time. Therefore, you should seal cracks and holes with caulking around: window and door frames along baseboards around electrical outlets\" From: Health risks of asbestos , Government of Canada Where can asbestos be found in the home? Back to top You cannot tell if a product contains asbestos just by looking at it. The only way to tell is to have it tested by a laboratory. Is asbestos always a hazard? Back to top No, not always. Products in good condition (not deteriorating, etc.) may not be releasing fibres. If a material shows signs of damage such as tears, cracks or water damage, talk to a professional consultant. When examining the product, don't touch it as you may unintentionally release fibres into the air. Asbestos fibres can be released into the air in homes when: Disturbing loose-fill vermiculite insulation which may contain asbestos. Removing deteriorating roofing shingles and siding containing asbestos, or tampering with roofing felt that contains asbestos. Ripping away old asbestos insulation from around a hot water tank. Sanding or scraping vinyl asbestos floor tiles. Breaking apart acoustical ceilings tiles containing asbestos. Sanding plaster containing asbestos, or sanding or disturbing acoustical plaster that gives ceilings and walls a soft, textured look. Sanding or scraping older water-based asbestos coatings such as roofing compounds, spackling, sealants, paint, putty, caulking or drywall. Sawing, drilling or smoothing rough edges of new or old asbestos materials. Can I remove asbestos from my home myself? Back to top No, you should not. Asbestos fibres can easily become air borne, creating a risk of serious illness if proper precautions are not taken. If you suspect there might be asbestos containing material and before renovations can take place, the product or material must be tested. If there is asbestos is present, proper procedures must be used before the material can be disturbed (removed, or cut). In many areas, there are strict regulations that define the procedures that must be used when working with different types of asbestos. Even if the work is to be done outdoors, these requirements must be followed. For example, in Ontario, any worker that is involved in an asbestos abatement project must have received proper training. If the worker is involved in a type 3 operation , the worker must have received training that is approved by the Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities. Can I paint or encapsulate the asbestos myself? Back to top It is not recommended that asbestos products be painted. Painting over the insulation (e.g., when wrapped around pipes) is not a method of encapsulation. The paint may seal the product somewhat, but it may not prevent the insulation from becoming friable (broken into smaller pieces). In addition, the 'act' of painting or trying to encapsulate the asbestos by other methods may loosen asbestos fibres which then can become air borne. If there is concern about the asbestos product, it is recommended that it be removed safely or encapsulated by a professional contractor. What should I do? Back to top The best step is to hire a professional contractor or consultant familiar with asbestos removal. When hiring, confirm that they are qualified and have insurance that covers the type of asbestos work they will be completing. The person you hire should discuss the specific steps that must be taken to prepare the work area to make sure that: The dust is controlled. The right personal protective clothing and equipment is used. There is appropriate clean up of the work area and waste removal. Does CCOHS offer asbestos contracting or removal services? Back to top No. CCOHS does not offer any services related to asbestos testing, identification or removal. CCOHS does not maintain or have a list of asbestos removal contractors. Please check the Yellow pages in your phone book or use the Internet to find a contractor in your area. When hiring, confirm they are qualified and have insurance that covers the type of asbestos work they will be completing. Where can I get more information?

    "content": "BRCA gene test for breast and ovarian cancer risk - Mayo Clinic This content does not have an English version. This content does not have an Arabic version. Skip to content BRCA gene test for breast and ovarian cancer risk Request an Appointment Print Overview The BRCA gene test looks for DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It uses a sample of blood or saliva to look for the changes. DNA is the genetic material inside cells. It holds the instructions, called genes, that tell cells what to do. Harmful changes in the genes can increase the risk of cancer. Healthcare professionals sometimes call these gene changes variants or mutations. The BRCA gene test looks for changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Other genes also can increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Some genetic tests look for these other genes in addition to the BRCA genes. A genetic test that looks at many different genes is called a multigene panel test. A healthcare professional can help you decide whether genetic testing is right for you. The gene changes that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancer are passed from parents to children. So the health professional considers your personal and family history of cancer when making a recommendation. Genetic testing isn't routinely done on people with an average risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The results of genetic testing aren't always clear. A positive result means you carry a gene change that increases your risk of cancer. You can work with your healthcare team to manage that risk. A negative result may mean that you don't have the gene change. It also may mean that you might have a gene change that hasn't been discovered yet. Your test also might find a gene change that doctors aren't certain about. In these situations, it's not always clear what the results mean for your cancer risk. Most people considering genetic testing undergo genetic counseling. Genetic counseling can help you understand what the results could mean for your health. It also can help you decide whether genetic testing is right for you. Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic Why it's done The BRCA gene test looks for DNA changes that increase the risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most well-known genes. Testing often looks for those genes and many other genes that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Changes in these genes significantly increase the risk of many cancers, including: Breast cancer. Male breast cancer. Ovarian cancer. Prostate cancer. Pancreatic cancer. If a gene change is found, you and your healthcare team can work together to manage your risk. Who should consider genetic testing? People with the following should consider genetic testing for genes that increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers: A personal history of breast cancer. A personal history of ovarian cancer. A personal history of pancreatic cancer. A personal history of prostate cancer. A blood relative with a history of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer or prostate cancer. A blood relative who had genetic testing and was found to have a gene change that increases the risk of breast cancer. Ideally, genetic testing should be done on a family member who has had breast or ovarian cancer. If that person doesn't have gene changes, then the rest of the family might not need testing. However, there might be other genetic tests to consider. A genetic counselor or other healthcare professional trained in genetics can help you decide what test might be best. Other breast cancer genes Researchers have found changes in other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer. Your healthcare team might recommend testing for these gene changes, too, based on your family history of cancer. This is known as multigene panel testing. A multigene panel test looks for changes in many different genes. It can be used to look for changes in the BRCA genes and other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer.

Sorry something went wrong with your subscription Please, try again in a couple of minutes Retry Risks There's no medical risk associated with the BRCA gene test or any other genetic test that looks for a risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Having blood drawn for the test carries some minor risks. These may include bleeding, bruising and lightheadedness. Other effects of genetic testing include the emotional, financial, medical and social implications of your test results. People who test positive for a gene change may face: Feeling anxious, angry, or sad about your health and your family's health. Concerns over possible insurance discrimination. Strained family relationships. Difficult decisions about the steps to take to prevent cancer. Coping with the worry that you'll eventually get cancer. There also may be some emotional concerns if you test negative or if you receive results that aren't clear-cut. In these situations, there may be: \"Survivor guilt\" that can happen if family members have positive results and you don't. Uncertainty and concern that your result may not be a true negative result. This can happen if your results show you have a gene change that doctors aren't sure about. Your genetic counselor or another professional trained in genetics can help you work through any of these feelings. That person can provide you and your family support throughout this process. How you prepare The first step in the BRCA gene testing process is to undergo genetic counseling. To do this, you meet with a genetic counselor or another healthcare professional trained in genetics. This person can help you understand whether testing is right for you and which genes should be tested. You also will discuss the potential risks, limitations and benefits of genetic testing. The genetic counselor or other genetics professional asks detailed questions about your family and medical history. The information helps to assess your risk of having an inherited gene change that increases the risk of cancer. To prepare for your meeting with the genetics professional: Gather information about your family's medical history, especially that of close relatives. Document your personal medical history. This includes collecting records from specialists or results of previous genetic testing, if available. Write down questions to ask about genetic testing. Consider having a friend or family member come with you. That person can help ask questions or take notes. It's up to you whether you choose to have genetic testing. If you decide to have genetic testing, prepare yourself. Consider the emotional and social effects that learning your genetic status might have. Test results also may not provide you with clear-cut answers regarding your cancer risk. So prepare to face that possibility too. What you can expect The BRCA gene test is most often a blood test. A member of your healthcare team inserts a needle into a vein, usually in your arm. The needle draws out the blood sample. The sample goes to a lab for DNA testing. Sometimes other sample types are collected for DNA testing, including saliva. If you have a family history of cancer and are interested in a saliva DNA test, discuss this with your healthcare team. A genetic counselor or other health professional trained in genetics can tell you the best sample type for your genetic testing. Results The results of a BRCA gene test may take a few weeks to come back. You will meet with your genetic counselor or other health professional trained in genetics to find out your test results. You also will discuss what the results mean and go over your options. Your test results may be positive, negative or uncertain. Positive test result A positive test result means that you have changes in a gene that are associated with a higher risk of cancer. But a positive result doesn't mean that you're certain to develop cancer. Your healthcare team will create a cancer screening plan based on your risk for cancer. You might need different screening tests or have screening more often. You also might consider medicines or surgery that can reduce your risk of cancer. Your options depend on many factors. These may include your age, medical history, past treatments and surgeries, and personal preferences. Negative or uncertain test result A negative test result means that no gene changes were found. However, you could still have a higher risk of cancer. A negative result is considered a \"true negative\" only if it finds that you don't carry the specific gene change that runs in your family. This type of negative test result means you have the same cancer risk as the general population. An uncertain test result might happen if your results show a gene change that doctors aren't sure about. This is called a variant of uncertain significance. A genetic counselor or other healthcare professional trained in genetics can help you understand this result. Researchers continue working to discover new gene changes. The research helps healthcare professionals understand how the gene changes might affect cancer risk. In time, most variants of uncertain significance get classified into either a positive or negative result. To be informed when this happens, stay in touch with the member of your healthcare team who ordered your genetic test. Genetic testing is an active area of research. If your gene test was done more than five years ago, your healthcare team might recommend testing again with newer tests. If your family health history changes, such as if additional family members develop cancer, your team also might recommend additional genetic testing.

People with FAP have multiple precancerous (benign) growths ( polyps ) in the colon, and one or more of these polyps will likely develop into colorectal cancer. There are two forms of FAP: the classic type and the attenuated type. The classic type of FAP is the more severe type. People with classic FAP develop colon polyps as early as childhood. By age 35 years, 95 percent of people with classic FAP will have colon polyps. Once polyps appear in people with classic FAP, the number of polyps increases quickly. People with classic FAP may have hundreds to thousands of colon polyps. Unless the colon is removed, one or more of these polyps will become cancerous (malignant). Individuals with classic FAP typically develop colorectal cancer around 40 years old, and at least 90 percent of affected individuals will develop colorectal cancer by age 50 years if they do not have a procedure that removes their colon beforehand (preventative colectomy). The attenuated type of FAP is the less severe form. People with attenuated FAP tend to have fewer polyps (an average of 30) that develop later in life (early to mid-adulthood) than those with classic FAP. People with attenuated FAP have a 70 percent lifetime risk of colorectal cancer, with cancer typically developing around 55 years old. People with attenuated FAP may or may not be advised to have a preventative colectomy. Less commonly, people with FAP may develop other types of cancer. Affected individuals are at increased risk of developing cancer of the stomach, pancreas, a gland in the lower neck (thyroid gland), liver (specifically, a form known as hepatoblastoma), brain (specifically, a form known as medulloblastoma), or a section of the small intestine (duodenum). People with FAP can also have benign growths in their bones (osteomas), in their skin (cysts), or in the small glands located on top of the kidneys called adrenal glands (adrenal masses). Other benign growths called desmoid tumors develop in 10 to 30 percent of people with FAP. These fibrous tumors usually occur in the abdomen or abdominal wall. Desmoid tumors tend to recur after they are surgically removed. People with FAP may also have dental abnormalities, which can include teeth that do not break through the gums, one or more missing teeth, extra (supernumerary) teeth, and dental cysts. Individuals with FAP often have an eye problem called congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). CHRPE is characterized by flat lesions on the light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye (retina) that can be seen during an eye exam. CHRPE does not cause any vision problems and occurs in up to 80 percent of people with FAP. Frequency FAP has an incidence of 1 in 8,500 individuals. FAP accounts for about 0.5 percent of all cases of colorectal cancer. Causes Variants (also called mutations) in the APC gene cause FAP. The APC gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. In particular, the APC protein helps block a signaling pathway that promotes cell growth and division. The APC protein also interacts with parts of the cell to help ensure that the number of chromosomes in a cell is correct after the cell divides. Most of the APC gene variants that cause FAP lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the APC protein. This shortened protein cannot block the signaling pathway, so cell growth is not controlled. This cell overgrowth leads to the colon polyps, tumors, and colorectal cancer seen in people with FAP. Additionally, the nonfunctional APC protein can impair normal cell division, which may result in an abnormal number of chromosomes in cells and contribute to cancer development in people with FAP. Learn more about the gene associated with Familial adenomatous polyposis APC Inheritance FAP is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , which means one copy of the altered APC gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Affected individuals have a 50 percent chance of passing on the APC gene variant to each child. In 75 to 80 percent of cases, an affected person has one parent with FAP.

Credit: iStock There are different types of caregivers for people with cancer. Some are family members, while others are friends. People of different races and cultures give care to others in their own way. Every situation is different and there isn’t one way that works best. Caregiving may be helping with day-to-day activities such as doctor visits or preparing food giving medicines or helping with physical therapy or other clinical tasks helping with tasks of daily living such as using the bathroom or bathing coordinating care and services from a distance by phone or email giving emotional and spiritual support Coping with Being a Cancer Caregiver Giving care and support during this time can be a challenge. Many caregivers put their own needs and feelings aside to focus on the person with cancer. This can be hard to maintain for a long time, and it’s not good for your health. The stress can have both physical and psychological effects. If you don’t take care of yourself, you won’t be able to take care of others. It’s important for everyone that you give care to you . For more information, see the NCI booklet When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer . Changing roles as a caregiver Whether you're younger or older, you may find yourself in a new role as a caregiver. You may have been an active part of someone's life before, but perhaps now that they're a cancer patient, the way you support them is different. It may be in a way in which you haven't had much experience, or in a way that feels more intense than before. Even though caregiving may feel new to you now, many caregivers say that they learn more as they go through their loved one's cancer experience. Common situations that they describe are below. Their loved one only feels comfortable with a spouse or partner taking care of them. Caregivers with children struggle to take care of a parent too. Parents may have a hard time accepting help from their adult children. Caregivers find it hard to balance taking care of a loved one with job responsibilities. Adult children with cancer may not want to rely on their parents for care. Caregivers may have health problems themselves, making it physically and emotionally hard to take care of someone else. Whatever your roles are now, it’s very common to feel confused and stressed at this time. If you can, try to share your feelings with others or join a support group . Or you may choose to seek help from a counselor . Mom was always the rock in the family. Now it's almost as though we're the parents and she's the child. It's hard because we have our own children to take care of and jobs to go to. Brian Ask for help from others Many caregivers say that, looking back, they took too much on themselves. Or they wish they had asked for help from friends or family sooner. Take an honest look at what you can and can't do. What things do you need or want to do yourself? What tasks can you turn over or share with people? Be willing to let go of things that others can help you do. Some examples may be: helping with chores, such as cooking, cleaning, shopping, or yard work taking care of the kids or picking them up from school or activities driving your loved one to appointments or picking up medicines being the contact person to keep others updated Accepting help from others isn't always easy. But remember that getting help for yourself can also help your loved one—you may stay healthier, your loved one may feel less guilty about all the things that you're doing, some of your helpers may offer useful skills and have extra time to give you. Websites such as SignUpGenius or Lotsa Helping Hands can help you organize requests and tasks. Be prepared for some people not to help When someone has a serious illness such as cancer, friends and family often reach out to help. And sometimes people you don't know very well also want to give you a hand. But it's important to realize that there are others who may not be able to help you. You might wonder why someone wouldn't offer to help you or your family when you're dealing with so much. Some common reasons are: some people may be coping with their own problems some may not have the time they are afraid of cancer or may have already had a bad experience with cancer. They don't want to get involved and feel pain all over again some people believe it's best to keep a distance when people are struggling sometimes people don't realize how hard things really are for you. Or they don't understand that you need help unless you ask them for it directly some people feel awkward because they don't know how to show they care If someone isn't giving you the help you need, you may want to talk to them and explain your needs. Or you can just let it go. But if the relationship is important, you may want to tell the person how you feel. This can help prevent resentment or stress from building up. These feelings could hurt your relationship in the long run. Taking Care of Yourself All family caregivers need support. But you may feel that your needs aren't important right now since you’re not the cancer patient. Or that there's no time left for yourself. You may be so used to taking care of someone else that it's hard for you to change focus. But caring for your own needs, hopes, and desires can give you the strength you need to carry on. (See the Caregiver's Bill of Rights in the booklet When Someone You Love Is Being Treated for Cancer: Support for Caregivers .) Ways to take care of yourself Taking the time to recharge your mind, body, and spirit can help you be a better caregiver. You may want to think about the tips below. Make time for yourself Find time to relax. Take at least 15-30 minutes each day to do something for yourself. For example, try to make time for a nap, exercise, yard work, a hobby, watching tv or a movie, or whatever you find relaxing. Do gentle exercises, such as stretching or yoga. Or, take deep breaths or just sit still for a minute. See Learning to Relax . Don't neglect your personal life. It's okay to cut back on personal activities, but don't cut them out entirely. For example, look for easy ways to connect with friends. Keep up your routine. If you can, try to keep doing some of your regular activities. If you don't, studies show that it can increase the stress you feel. You may have to do things at a different time of day or for less time than you normally would, but try to still do them. Ask for help. Find larger chunks of time that you can take for yourself by asking for help. Think about things others can do or arrange for you, such as appointments or errands. Understand your feelings Giving yourself an outlet for your own thoughts and feelings is important. Think about what would help lift your spirits. Would talking with others help ease your load? Or would you rather have quiet time by yourself? Maybe you need both, depending on what's going on in your life. It's helpful for you and others to know what you need. You may also be able to find some comfort by reading the Emotions and Cancer section of our website. See if any of them relate to you and what you can do for support. Join a support group Cancer support groups can meet in person, by phone, or online. They may help you gain new insights into what is happening, get ideas about how to cope, and help you know that you're not alone. In a support group, people may talk about their feelings, trade advice, and try to help others who are dealing with the same kinds of issues. Some people like to go and just listen. And others prefer not to join support groups at all. Some people aren't comfortable with this kind of sharing. If you can't find a group in your area, try a support group online. Some caregivers say websites with support groups have helped them a lot. Learn more about cancer Sometimes understanding your loved one's medical situation can make you feel more confident and in control. For example, you may want to know more about his or her type and stage of cancer. It may help you to know what to expect during treatment, such as the tests and procedures that will be done, as well as the side effects that will result. Talk to others about what you're going through Studies show that talking with other people about what you're dealing with is very important to most caregivers. It's especially helpful when you feel overwhelmed or want to say things that you can't say to your loved one with cancer. Talk to someone you can really open up to about your feelings or fears. You're allowed to feel angry, frustrated, or overwhelmed. You may want to talk with someone outside your inner circle. Some caregivers find it helpful to talk to a counselor, such as a social worker , psychologist , or leader in their faith or spiritual community. These types of experts may be able to help you talk about things that you don't feel you can talk about with friends or family. They can also help you find ways to express your feelings and learn ways to cope that you hadn't thought of before. Share time with your loved one with cancer Cancer may bring you and your loved one closer together than ever before. Often people become closer as they face challenges together. If you can, take time to share special moments with one another. Try to gain strength from all you're going through together, and what you have dealt with so far. This may help you move toward the future with a positive outlook and feelings of hope. Write in a Journal Research shows that writing or journaling can help relieve negative thoughts and feelings. And it may actually help improve your own health. You might write about your most stressful experiences. Or you may want to express your deepest thoughts and feelings. You can also write about things that make you feel good, such as a pretty day or a kind coworker or friend. Look for the positive It can be hard finding positive moments when you're busy caregiving. It also can be hard to adjust to your role as a caregiver. Caregivers say that looking for the good things in life and feeling gratitude help them feel better. And know that it's okay to laugh, even when your loved one is in treatment. In fact, it's healthy. Laughter releases tension and makes you feel better. Keeping your sense of humor in trying times is a good coping skill. Look for ways to feel thankful You may feel thankful that you can be there for your loved one. You may be glad for a chance to do something positive and give to another person in a way you never knew you could. Some caregivers feel that they've been given the chance to build or strengthen a relationship. This doesn't mean that caregiving is easy, stress-free, or without frustrations. But finding meaning in caregiving can make it easier to manage. Caring for your body When I get home from class, my mom and I take turns running while one of us stays with my dad. My run is my time for me, and the only way I can keep it together. Gail You may find yourself so busy and concerned about your loved one that you don't pay attention to your own physical health. But it's very important that you take care of your health, too. Doing so will give you strength to help others. It's important to: stay up-to-date with your medical needs Keep up with your own checkups, screenings, and other appointments. watch for signs of depression or anxiety Stress can cause many different feelings or body changes. But if the changes last for more than two weeks, talk to your doctor. Some caregivers realize they have become depressed and need help. take your medicine as prescribed Ask your doctor to give you a large prescription to save trips to the pharmacy. Find out if your grocery store or pharmacy delivers. try to eat healthy meals Eating well will help you keep up your strength. If your loved one is in the hospital or has long doctor's appointments, bring easy-to-prepare food from home. For example, sandwiches, salads, or packaged foods and canned meats fit easily into a lunch container. get enough rest Listening to soft music or doing breathing exercises may help you fall asleep. Short naps can energize you if you aren't getting enough sleep. Be sure to talk with your doctor if lack of sleep becomes an ongoing problem. exercise Walking, swimming, running, or bike riding are only a few ways to get your body moving. Any kind of exercise (including working in the garden, cleaning, mowing, or going up stairs) can help you keep your body healthy. Finding at least 15-30 minutes a day to exercise may make you feel better and help manage your stress. New stresses and daily demands often add to any health problems caregivers already have. And if you're sick or have an injury that requires you to be careful, it's even more important that you take care of yourself. Here are some changes caregivers often have: fatigue (feeling tired) weaker immune system (poor ability to fight off illness) sleep problems slower healing of wounds higher blood pressure changes in appetite or weight headaches anxiety, depression, or other mood changes Long-Distance Caregiving It can be very hard to be away from a loved one who has cancer. You may feel like you're a step behind in knowing what is happening with their care. Yet even if you live far away, it's possible for you to give support and be a problem-solver and care coordinator. Caregivers who live more than an hour away from their loved ones most often rely on the telephone or email as their communication link. But either of these methods can be rather limiting when trying to assess someone's needs. Aside from true medical emergencies, long-distance caregivers often need to judge whether situations can be dealt with over the phone or require an in-person visit. Stay in touch with others who are near your loved one Develop a relationship with one or two key members of the health care team, such as a nurse, social worker or patient educator. It may help you feel more at ease to have direct contact with someone involved in the medical care of your loved one. You and other family members could arrange conference calls or online meetings with them and other members of the team for updates. Other tips include: create a list of people who live near your loved one whom you could call day or night in a crisis or just to check in share a list of home, work, and cell phone numbers, and email addresses with the health care team. You should also give this to others who are local in case of an emergency look into volunteer visitors, adult day care centers, or meal delivery services in the area make a list of websites in your loved one's area to give you quick access to resources ask if the hospital keeps visitor information packets or lists that list area agencies and contacts Important things to know or do as a long-distance caregiver The National Institute on Aging suggests these tips below: Try to learn as much as you can about your loved one’s illness. Make sure at least one family member has written permission to receive medical and financial information about your loved one. If you can, gather and organize important paperwork for your loved one such as healthcare, medical care, advance directives, and any financial and legal issues that need to be in order. Put all vital information in one place such as a notebook or shared, secure online document. This may include medical care, financial records, or anything else you think is important for other family members or caregivers to have. Other ways to stay connected to your loved one from a distance Ask a local family member or friend to update you daily by email or text. Or, consider creating a website to share news about your loved one's condition and needs. There are a number of sites available. Examples are Caring Bridge and Lotsa Helping Hands . Sign up for online ways to connect with people. Programs using video and instant messaging to communicate are very common. For example, Zoom and FaceTime are ways people connect from a distance. Airlines or bus lines may have special deals for patients or family members. The hospital social worker may also know of other resources, such as private pilots, advocacy organizations, or companies that help people with cancer and their families with transportation. If you're traveling to see your loved one, time your flights or drives so that you have time to rest when you return. Many long-distance caregivers say that they don't allow themselves enough time to rest after their visits. Review your long-distance and cell phone plans. See if you can make any changes that would reduce your bills. For more tips, see the National Institute on Aging's Long-Distance Caregiving page. Print Email",

Overview of water filter technologies Filtering drinking water at home can reduce contaminants that water utilities don't remove. It can also help with reducing contaminants from water utility treatment, such as disinfection byproducts, and from the water distribution system, such as lead. Most water filter products on the market use one or a combination of two primary technologies: carbon filtration and reverse osmosis. Common Filter Technologies Carbon-based The majority of commercial carbon filters use activated carbon. This traps and removes contaminants as water flows through the filter. These filters consist of high carbon materials, like coconut shells or wood, that have been heated to create a porous structure. The effectiveness of these filters can vary significantly. Some are certified only to reduce chlorine from water treatment, improving taste and odor. Others can reduce the levels of contaminants such as lead, disinfection by-products and volatile organic compounds, or VOCs. Activated carbon filters are less effective at removing some contaminants, such as nitrate, perchlorate and 1,4 dioxane. Carbon filters are typically sold as either carbon block or granulated activated carbon. Carbon block filters contain activated carbon that is shaped into dense blocks under high pressure. They’re usually more expensive than granular activated carbon but are generally more effective in removing a broader range of chemicals. That’s because they have more surface area that comes into contact with water and a slower rate of filtration. But they may need to be replaced more often. Granulated activated carbon filters contain loose, fine grains of activated carbon. They are usually somewhat less effective than carbon block filters, because the water flows through them more quickly. Reverse osmosis Reverse osmosis systems sold for home installation typically also include one or more activated carbon and sediment filters, which reduces or removes a large range of contaminants. The initial activated carbon treatment captures and removes chlorine, trihalomethanes and VOCs. Next, during reverse osmosis filtration, tap water is pushed under pressure through a semipermeable membrane that blocks any particles or contaminants larger than water molecules. As a result, reverse osmosis systems effectively remove a wide range of contaminants, like arsenic, hexavalent chromium, nitrates and perchlorate. The primary drawback of reverse osmosis systems is how much water they waste. These systems require inputs of about three to five times more water than they produce, and the extra water flows down the drain. Reverse osmosis filters also remove minerals that improve the taste of water and are essential for health, such as iron, calcium and magnesium. Some manufacturers of reverse osmosis systems may offer options to address this problem, like mineral drops consumers can add back to their water. Other kinds of filters Ion exchange and water softeners Water softeners typically use an ion exchange process to reduce levels of calcium and magnesium, which can build up in plumbing and fixtures, as well as barium and radium, which can be found in treated tap water. The levels of other contaminants usually remain unchanged. Since water softeners replace calcium and magnesium with sodium, doctors may advise people with certain health conditions, such as those who wish to maintain a low-sodium diet, to avoid softened water. This type of filtered water is also not recommended for watering plants and gardens, since salty water can harm plants. Distillation This technology heats water enough to vaporize it and then condenses the steam to form water again. The process removes minerals, many bacteria and viruses, and some chemicals that have a higher boiling point than water. But it may only partially remove chlorine, trihalomethanes or VOCs. Home distillation systems are less common than other types of water filters. Whole house filters Whole house filters are installed at the point where water enters a house, so that all taps and appliances receive filtered water. These systems can use ion exchange, reverse osmosis or activated carbon technology. This type of system is expensive compared to point-of-use filtration and is usually not necessary in most cases. An example of when a whole system might be needed is if the water contains high levels of radiologicals or high levels of iron that may damage home appliances. Since whole house systems can remove chlorine, they may introduce the additional risk of harmful bacterial growth in plumbing. Whole house reverse osmosis filtration systems waste a large amount of water. February 2025",

Update : On June 18, the Center for Environmental Health, a nonprofit organization based in Oakland, Calif., announced that independent testing it commissioned found high levels of arsenic in Starkey bottled water (owned by Whole Foods) and Peñafiel bottled water (owned by Keurig Dr Pepper). The organization sent legal notices to the manufacturers, asserting the products require a health warning under California's Proposition 65 law. The arsenic levels detected in CEH's tests were not disclosed. Update: On May 3, CR reported that the FDA had still not called for a recall of Peñafiel, based on what's known to date. We also reported that EartH₂O has provided updated test results, showing arsenic levels in its spring bottled water has gone down from 3 parts per billion to 2ppb, within CR's recommended limit. Update: On April 26, CR learned that the Food and Drug Administration has known of high arsenic levels in Peñafiel bottled water , from Keurig Dr Pepper, since at least 2013. This story was originally published on April 18, 2019. Natural foods grocery chain Whole Foods introduced its new brand of bottled water at a 2015 investor event, where company executives heralded the product’s purity and healthfulness. “It naturally flows out of the ground,” chief operating officer A.C. Gallo said about the company’s spring in Council, Idaho, according to a published transcript on its website. “We built, actually, a spring house over it so we can let the water go down to the bottling plant. It’s amazingly pristine water.” Yet from late 2016 to early 2017, Starkey Water—the name of Whole Foods’ brand—recalled more than 2,000 cases of water after tests by regulators showed an impermissible level of arsenic beyond the federally mandated threshold of 10 parts per billion. A year later, Whole Foods’ internal testing showed results that were just under the federal limit but still at levels that pose risks if regularly consumed, according to growing research and independent experts, including Consumer Reports’ scientists. Over the past few years, as consumers have worried more about the quality of municipal tap water, bottled water has surged in popularity. It's now the nation’s best-selling bottled beverage, according to the International Bottled Water Association. But a CR investigation has found that in some cases bottled water on store shelves contains more potentially harmful arsenic than tap water flowing into some homes. “It makes no sense that consumers can purchase bottled water that is less safe than tap water,” says James Dickerson, Ph.D., chief scientific officer at Consumer Reports. “If anything, bottled water—a product for which people pay a premium, often because they assume it’s safer—should be regulated at least as strictly as tap water.” For this report, CR tracked down and reviewed hundreds of public records and test reports from bottled water brands, and from various federal and state regulators. We found that several popular brands sell bottled water with arsenic levels at or above 3 ppb; current research suggests that amounts above that level are potentially dangerous to drink over extended periods of time. CR believes the federal limit for bottled water should be revised to 3 ppb from the current federal standard of 10 ppb. In total, CR identified 11 brands out of more than 130 that either self-reported or, based on tests we commissioned, had detectable amounts of arsenic. Of those, six had levels of 3 ppb or higher. These brands are Starkey (owned by Whole Foods), Peñafiel (owned by Keurig Dr Pepper), Crystal Geyser Alpine Spring Water, Volvic (owned by Danone), and two regional brands, Crystal Creamery and EartH₂O. As part of our investigation, CR also was able to purchase two brands of imported water—Jermuk from Armenia and Peñafiel from Mexico—that are on an import alert issued by the federal government for previously having arsenic levels above the federal limit of 10 ppb. Such an alert is meant to “prevent potentially violative products from being distributed in the United States,” according to the Food and Drug Administration. Even so, CR easily purchased the two brands in retail stores in two states and on Amazon. A spokesperson for the FDA, which regulates bottled water, wouldn’t comment directly on the availability of the products but said that the agency takes the issue of heavy metals “seriously” and that if a product on the market is deemed “adulterated,” the agency will take “appropriate action.” Beverage giant Keurig Dr Pepper provided CR in March with Peñafiel's bottled water quality report for 2018, which stated that the water had nondetectable amounts of arsenic. But the company said this week that it had conducted new testing, because of CR’s questions, and confirmed levels above the federal limit, at an average of 17 ppb. More On Arsenic Arsenic and Lead Are in Your Fruit Juice: What You Need to Know Arsenic in Your Food Heavy Metals in Baby Food: What You Need to Know Keurig Dr Pepper said Monday that it had suspended bottled water production for two weeks at its Mexico facility that makes Peñafiel for export to the U.S. It plans to improve filtration at the plant to lower arsenic levels, the company told CR. For its latest internal testing, the company said it used a different protocol and consulted the FDA. A recall isn’t planned, Peñafiel said, but CR believes one should be issued. “An arsenic level of 17 ppb is a clear violation of the federal bottled water standard of 10 ppb,” says Jean Halloran, director of food policy initiatives at CR. “Keurig Dr Pepper should recall all Peñafiel water currently on the market that may contain these violative levels. If they do not act, the FDA should mandate a recall.” ❮ ❯ The FDA adopted a standard that no bottled water in the United States can have over 10 parts per billion of arsenic. Peñafiel bottled water seized in December 2014 by the Food and Drug Administration. The agency found that the water had excessive arsenic levels. Source: FDA Source: FDA The bottled water brands in the chart below have arsenic levels at or above 3 parts per billion, the maximum amount Consumer Reports recommends for bottled water. That is below the Food and Drug Administration’s 10 ppb limit. The results are the most recent available from the companies themselves, or in the case of Starkey Water (owned by Whole Foods) and Peñafiel (owned by Keurig Dr Pepper), from CR’s own tests. *Keurig Dr Pepper told CR on April 15 that it had temporarily stopped production at its Mexico facility to address the problem. The bottled water brands listed below have self-reported levels of arsenic that are nondetectable or below 3 parts per billion—the maximum amount recommended by Consumer Reports—based on the most recent data available from the companies themselves (listed in alphabetical order).

    "content": "Sustainable Fish Buying Guide Skip to main content Credit: Getty Images The seafood industry is in trouble. While fish is a key part of the diet for billions of people—and while the industry itself remains integral to the economies of coastal nations across the globe—the stats are bleak. Inadequate fisheries laws, poor enforcement on the high seas, and complex, obscure supply chains for many seafood products have led an estimated one-third of the world’s annual catch to be illegally fished. These factors all contribute to overfishing and mean that today, only 66 percent of wild marine fish stock are considered to exist at biologically sustainable levels. Over the last 50 years, fishing has been the major cause of marine biodiversity loss in the ocean, contributing to the global biodiversity crisis. Climate change is also affecting fisheries: As our ocean warms rapidly, fish populations off our coasts are moving into cooler waters, dwindling in productivity, and facing more frequent marine heat waves and other environmental challenges. Ocean acidification , which is intensifying as the oceans absorb more carbon dioxide, is a direct threat to the survival of shellfish and degrades the coral reefs that provide essential habitat. Separately, the impacts of the plastic waste crisis are also taking a toll on marine life. Thankfully, shoppers are increasingly factoring in sustainability when purchasing seafood. And the United States remains a global leader in sustainable fishing. But when browsing the fish counter or dinner menu, the options can sometimes feel overwhelming. So to help you make the best choices, keep these five tips in mind. Buy American-caught seafood to support strong fishery management. Given the numerous threats to our oceans, consumers should make their best efforts to buy fish caught sustainably in U.S. waters. Referring to the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch is a good place to start. Why choose domestically caught seafood over imports? As much as 32 percent of imports sold in the United States—nearly $2.4 billion worth, in 2019 alone—is harvested through illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing . This complex global problem thwarts legitimate fisheries management and drives overfishing, jeopardizing the health of many fish stocks. Other problems include bycatch (the unintentional capture of other marine species, such as dolphins and sea turtles, in fishing nets), as well as destructive harvesting methods like bottom trawling, which can devastate deep-sea corals, sponge fields, and other unique habitats and denizens of the ocean floor. Global bycatch of whales, dolphins, and other marine mammals is the leading driver of marine mammal decline, killing or seriously injuring more than 650,000 animals every year. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, foreign fisheries are supposed to meet stringent U.S. bycatch standards—a fact that wildlife advocates say our government must take more seriously and one that concerned consumers can address by refusing imported seafood. Play Video: Illegal Fishing Is a Human Tragedy Watch this video from our sister organization, NRDC Action Fund, to learn more about illegal fishing. These issues not only threaten ocean health but can destabilize economies and increase international conflict, precisely because the lucrative industry often and so easily evades authorities. IUU fishing is also directly tied to forced labor and human rights abuses at sea and in the seafood supply chain. As a top market for seafood, the United States has the ability to influence change. But much work remains to build an effective American seafood traceability program, including expanding the Seafood Import Monitoring Program, which is overseen by NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service and is a crucial tool to helping combat IUU fishing and labor abuses at sea. A whole other issue with imported fish is the lack of regulations on some overseas fish farms, where fish can be exposed to dangerous antibiotics and chemicals (many of which are banned in the United States). The clincher? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only inspects about 2 percent of all seafood that comes from abroad. Of course, not all U.S. fisheries are sustainably managed or adequately ensuring the overall health of ocean ecosystems. As one piece of evidence, take the continued decline of endangered North Atlantic right whales, for which entanglement in lobster lines is a top threat. However, the nation’s primary fisheries law, the Magnuson-Stevens Act , has played a critical role in curbing overfishing and rebuilding dozens of once-depleted fish stocks in U.S. waters. Diversify to prevent overfishing. Year after year, Americans opt predominantly for the same five types of seafood: shrimp, salmon, canned tuna, tilapia, and pollock. Each comes with its own set of concerns, but such high demand on only a handful of aquatic species can lead to overfishing, harmful catch methods, habitat destruction, and overuse of antibiotics in the case of farmed fish. (This risk does not apply to all farmed fish; open-ocean farms tend to be the worst offenders when it comes to antibiotics use and pollutants.) Meanwhile, the protected ocean waters along the U.S. coasts are teeming with hundreds of delicious and currently abundant species, like mussels, oysters, rockfish, and scup (aka porgy). By choosing to eat these underappreciated species, we can minimize damage and help U.S. fisheries continue to rebound. Even different edible seaweed varieties, which have the potential to absorb carbon dioxide from the ocean and are available dried in many markets, can provide that salty, savory flavor that seafood lovers crave. Think small to keep it clean. Mercury is a dangerous neurotoxin that can disrupt brain function and harm the nervous system. High concentrations of this pollutant (which can be traced back to emissions from coal-burning power plants) in both ocean predators, like tuna and swordfish, as well as freshwater fish, such as bass and trout, put consumers at risk of adverse health effects. It’s especially threatening to pregnant women and young children. As a general rule, smaller seafood—like sardines, scallops, squid—contain less mercury than larger varieties like tuna and swordfish. Why is that? Mercury pollution (much like other dangerous particles, including microplastics ) settles to the seafloor and is then taken in by organisms that live or feed on bottom sediments. These compounds aren't digested; instead, they accumulate within the animals that ingest them. As they pass through the food chain, they become more and more concentrated—a process known as biomagnification. So when a tuna eats a bunch of anchovies, the tuna is accumulating the mercury of all those anchovies into its own body. This handy chart produced by the FDA, which tests fish for mercury, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which determines mercury levels that it considers safe for women of childbearing age, helps you figure out which fish are safer to eat than others when it comes to avoiding mercury. Eat local fish and shellfish. You’ve heard of farm to table, but what about boat to table? Community-supported fisheries —modeled on community-supported agricultural programs, where customers pay to receive a regular share of a farmer’s harvest—are growing in popularity. Joining a community-supported fishery is an excellent way to know exactly where your fish comes from, who caught it, and how. (Small-scale, sustainable fishermen often employ lower-impact catch methods like hook and line or pots and traps.) These programs help bolster regional fishing economies while increasing demand for local, sustainable seafood. Some, like oyster and kelp farmers , even help to boost climate resiliency in local waters. Visit localcatch.org to find a CSF in your area. Be vigilant about wild capture and fish farms. If you can't join a CSF, buy your seafood from trusted retailers and restaurants. Certain businesses have set higher standards for the seafood they sell in their stores, and many have pledged to create long-term sustainable seafood plans. By simply asking if a store or restaurant offers sustainable seafood, you can help shape demand for fish that has been caught or farmed in environmentally responsible ways. This video from Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program highlights why such questions are important. Play Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoIuOcMfc50 Some shops make use of labels that help take the guesswork out of making ethical choices when you shop. In addition to Seafood Watch’s “best choice” recommendations, certification programs worth paying attention to include that of the Aquaculture Stewardship Council, which evaluates aquaculture practices involved in responsible fish farming, and Fair Trade USA, which focuses on the labor conditions and other social impacts for workers in the seafood industry. However, be wary of greenwashing—where industries create the appearance of eco-friendly practices for consumers without actually doing the work.

Print Email What are heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and how are they formed in cooked meats? Heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are chemicals formed when muscle meat, including beef, pork, fish, or poultry, is cooked using high-temperature methods, such as pan frying or grilling directly over an open flame ( 1 ). In laboratory experiments, HCAs and PAHs have been found to be mutagenic—that is, they cause changes in DNA that may increase the risk of cancer. HCAs are formed when amino acids (the building blocks of proteins), sugars, and creatine or creatinine (substances found in muscle) react at high temperatures. PAHs are formed when fat and juices from meat grilled directly over a heated surface or open fire drip onto the surface or fire, causing flames and smoke. The smoke contains PAHs that then adhere to the surface of the meat. PAHs can also be formed during other food preparation processes, such as smoking of meats ( 1 ). HCAs are not found in significant amounts in foods other than meat cooked at high temperatures. PAHs can be found in other smoked foods, as well as in cigarette smoke and car exhaust fumes. What factors influence the formation of HCA and PAH in cooked meats? The formation of HCAs and PAHs varies by meat type, cooking method, and “doneness” level (rare, medium, or well done). Whatever the type of meat, however, meats cooked at high temperatures, especially above 300 ºF (as in grilling or pan frying), or that are cooked for a long time tend to form more HCAs. For example, well-done, grilled, or barbecued chicken and steak all have high concentrations of HCAs. Cooking methods that expose meat to smoke contribute to PAH formation ( 2 ). HCAs and PAHs become capable of damaging DNA only after they are metabolized by specific enzymes in the body, a process called “bioactivation.” Studies have found that the activity of these enzymes, which can differ among people, may be relevant to the cancer risks associated with exposure to these compounds ( 3 – 9 ). What evidence is there that HCAs and PAHs in cooked meats may increase cancer risk? Studies have shown that exposure to HCAs and PAHs can cause cancer in animal models ( 10 ). In many experiments, rodents fed a diet supplemented with HCAs developed tumors of the breast, colon, liver, skin, lung, prostate, and other organs ( 11 – 16 ). Rodents fed PAHs also developed cancers, including leukemia and tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs ( 17 ). However, the doses of HCAs and PAHs used in these studies were very high—equivalent to thousands of times the doses that a person would consume in a normal diet. Population studies have not established a definitive link between HCA and PAH exposure from cooked meats and cancer in humans. One difficulty with conducting such studies is that it can be difficult to determine the exact level of HCA and/or PAH exposure a person gets from cooked meats. Although dietary questionnaires can provide good estimates, they may not capture all the detail about cooking techniques that is necessary to determine HCA and PAH exposure levels. In addition, individual variation in the activity of enzymes that metabolize HCAs and PAHs may result in exposure differences, even among people who ingest (take in) the same amount of these compounds. Also, people may have been exposed to PAHs from other environmental sources, not just food. Numerous epidemiologic studies have used detailed questionnaires to examine participants’ meat consumption and cooking methods ( 18 ). Researchers found that high consumption of well-done, fried, or barbecued meats was associated with increased risks of colorectal ( 19 – 21 ), pancreatic ( 21 – 23 ), and prostate ( 24 , 25 ) cancer. However, other studies have found no association with risks of colorectal ( 26 ) or prostate ( 27 ) cancer. In 2015, an independent panel of experts convened by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined consumption of red meat to be “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2A), based largely on data from the epidemiologic studies and on the strong evidence from mechanistic studies. However, IARC did not conclude that HCAs and PAHs were associated with cancer incidence. Do guidelines exist for the consumption of food containing HCAs and PAHs? Currently, no Federal guidelines address the consumption of foods containing HCAs and PAHs. The World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research issued a report in 2007 with dietary guidelines that recommended limiting the consumption of red and processed (including smoked) meats; however, no recommendations were provided for HCA and PAH levels in meat ( 28 ). Are there ways to reduce HCA and PAH formation in cooked meats? Even though no specific guidelines for HCA/PAH consumption exist, concerned individuals can reduce their exposure by using several cooking methods: Avoiding direct exposure of meat to an open flame or a hot metal surface and avoiding prolonged cooking times (especially at high temperatures) can help reduce HCA and PAH formation ( 29 ). Using a microwave oven to cook meat prior to exposure to high temperatures can also substantially reduce HCA formation by reducing the time that meat must be in contact with high heat to finish cooking ( 29 ). Continuously turning meat over on a high heat source can substantially reduce HCA formation compared with just leaving the meat on the heat source without flipping it often ( 29 ). Removing charred portions of meat and refraining from using gravy made from meat drippings can also reduce HCA and PAH exposure ( 29 ). What research is being conducted on the relationship between the consumption of HCAs and PAHs and cancer risk in humans? Researchers in the United States are currently investigating the association between meat intake, meat cooking methods, and cancer risk. Ongoing studies include the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study ( 19 , 30 ), the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Study II ( 31 ), the Multiethnic Cohort ( 6 ), and studies from Harvard University ( 32 ). Similar research in a European population is being conducted in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study ( 33 ). Print Email",

    "content": "Businesses Chemicals to Avoid in Cosmetics | Red List Our Red List is a resource for businesses to assess the safety of the ingredients in the personal care products they make and sell. Download PDF: Red List For information on how to use our Red List, contact us . The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics (CSC) developed the Red List of Chemicals of Concern in Cosmetics to serve as a resource and tool to help brands, companies, and retailers reduce their use of toxic chemicals in the beauty and personal care products they make and sell. Adopting and making a list of prohibited (or “do not use”) substances publicly available helps companies and consumers alike by advancing transparency, increasing customer trust, and guiding safer product formulations. It also establishes guidelines for suppliers of fragrance, raw materials, and finished products to ensure these entities are aware of and avoid the use of chemicals the company has pledged to eliminate. In 2015, BCPP’s Campaign for Safe Cosmetics developed a Red List of Chemicals of Concern in cosmetics . The list included 102 chemicals found in personal care products that pose serious, chronic health concerns including cancer, hormone disruption , and reproductive and developmental harm. In 2018, we then expanded the Red List of Chemicals of Concern to also include chemicals used in cleaning products and fragrances. The updated list included the original cosmetics Red List , fragrance ingredients found through product testing, as well as authoritative lists of hazardous chemicals compiled by colleague organizations, researchers, and reputable scientific organizations. Your Action Helps Together, we can make beauty safer for all. Take Action Today! Our most recent iteration of the Red List of Chemicals of Concern, released in August 2022, expanded to 480 chemicals used in beauty, personal care products, and/or as fragrance ingredients. The list includes: 241 Tier 1 chemicals of concern that should be prohibited from use in personal care products or as fragrance ingredients by manufacturers and retailers. 112 Tier 2 emerging chemicals of concern which should be avoided in products whenever possible. 127 Tier 3 asthmagens, allergens and irritants whose presence in products should be disclosed so people suffering from these adverse health effects can avoid these chemicals of concern. More about the three tiers Tier 1: Chemicals of concern that should not be used in personal care products or fragrances. Chemicals that are listed on an authoritative list (such as the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the National Toxicology Program (NTP), California’s Prop. 65 Program, etc.) as being harmful to human health are listed as Tier 1 chemicals and the relevant authoritative list is marked. Chemicals that are not on authoritative lists but for which our literature review found multiple studies linking them with relevant human health effects are listed as Tier 1 chemicals and the citations are marked. Tier 2: Emerging chemicals of concern that should be avoided in products if possible. Chemicals that have only a single study indicating a human health concern are listed as emerging chemicals of concern and placed on Tier 2. Chemicals that have been designated as ecotoxicants by authoritative bodies are also placed on Tier 2. Tier 3: Asthmagens, allergens and irritants whose presence in products should be disclosed as potential allergens. Chemicals that have been identified as asthmagens, allergens or irritants by the authoritative organizations that we cite in the Red List should be disclosed if they are present in products so that consumers with sensitivities can avoid them. If the chemical is also listed on Tier 2, they should be avoided in products if possible. For a list of the authoritative governmental and scientific lists of hazardous chemicals used to build the Red List, and a discussion on chemicals of concern listed as Tier 1 chemicals because of special circumstances, see Appendix 1. As a key part of CSC’s Black Beauty Project , our third iteration of the Red List includes cosmetic chemicals of concern negatively impacting Black women’s health ( Tier 1 “Do Not Use” Chemicals of Greater Concern for Black Women ). To create this newest addition to the Red List, we worked with our Advisory Committee made up of leading non-profit organizations and scientists working to improve Black women’s health and conducted a scientific literature review to identify chemicals of concern in beauty products used by Black women that are linked to negative health outcomes. This project represents the first comprehensive effort to generate a list of chemicals of concern in Black beauty products that should be avoided by consumers, cosmetic manufacturers, and retailers. Our Red List’s Tier 1 “Do Not Use” Chemicals of Greater Concern for Black Women also attempts to address: 1) bias in scientific research on chemical exposures that does not adequately account for the unequal burden Black women experience through their use of beauty products; and 2) inadequate capture of hazardous chemicals linked to negative health outcomes in Black women by governmental and scientific organizations that create authoritative lists of hazardous chemicals. Our goal was to identify and better understand chemicals negatively impacting Black women’s health that are present in beauty and personal care products in order to address their unique health concerns. In total, we reviewed 8,119 titles and 580 scientific papers. Through this review process, we identified 141 scientific studies that showed a significant association between chemicals in personal care products and health concerns for Black women. We then expanded the CSC’s Red List to include the findings from these studies to have a more representative list of both the chemicals of concern in beauty and personal care products marketed to Black women and related negative health outcomes. With this latest update, companies can use our Red List to avoid ingredients linked to health outcomes of greater concern to Black women.

BMC Endocr Disord 14, 86 (2014). https://doi.org/10.1186/1472-6823-14-86 Vagi et al conducted a case-control pilot study to determine whether women with PCOS have higher concentrations of specific environmental contaminants. The group reported that women with PCOS had higher serum concentrations of two PFCs, PFOA and PFOS. However, these women had lower urinary concentrations of mBP and mBzP [103]. Preterm Birth​ Ashrap, P., Watkins, D. J., Mukherjee, B., Boss, J., Richards, M. J., Rosario, Z., Vélez-Vega, C. M., Alshawabkeh, A., Cordero, J. F., & Meeker, J. D. (2020).

Environment international, 138, 105606. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105606 Ashrap et al conducted a study using the Puerto Rico Test site for Exploring Contamination Threats cohort to observe the effects of metals and metalloids on birth outcomes. The group reported that lead exposure was associated with a higher odd of preterm birth and shorter gestational age. To a smaller extent, manganese, zinc, mercury, and nickel were associated with similar outcomes [48]. Baker, B. H., Wu, H., Laue, H. E., Boivin, A., Gillet, V., Langlois, M. F., Bellenger, J. P., Baccarelli, A. A., & Takser, L. (2020). Methylparaben in meconium and risk of maternal thyroid dysfunction, adverse birth outcomes, and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Environment international, 139, 105716. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2020.105716 Baker et al used data from the GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) prospective observational pregnancy cohort to determine if there is a relationship between prenatal exposure to methylparaben and adverse health outcomes. The group reported that the presence of methylparaben in meconium samples was associated with the onset of preterm birth, decreased gestational age, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and more [49]. Bloom, M. S., Wenzel, A. G., Brock, J. W., Kucklick, J. R., Wineland, R. J., Cruze, L., Unal, E. R., Yucel, R. M., Jiyessova, A., & Newman, R. B. (2019).

Environment international, 127, 473–486. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.04.005 Bloom et al conducted an observational study of southeastern women in the United States to determine racial differences in maternal phthalate exposure, fetal growth, and birth outcomes. The group reported that high levels of MEHP were associated with small gestational age in whites, but not blacks. However, higher levels of MiBP were associated with preterm birth in blacks, but not whites. Overall, higher levels of MEP were associated with low birth weight in males but not females, independent of race [51]. Gokoel, A. R., Zijlmans, W., Covert, H.

International journal of environmental research and public health, 17(12), 4444. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124444 Gokoel aimed to assess the influence of prenatal mercury exposure, perceived stress, and depression on adverse birth outcomes in Surinamese women within the Caribbean Consortium for Research in Environmental and Occupational Health prospective cohort. They reported associations between mercury exposure and preterm birth and perceived stress. However, depression was not associated with any birth outcomes [62]. Nyanza, E. C., Dewey, D., Manyama, M., Martin, J. W., Hatfield, J., & Bernier, F. P. (2020). Maternal exposure to arsenic and mercury and associated risk of adverse birth outcomes in small-scale gold mining communities in Northern Tanzania. Environment international, 137, 105450. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2019.105450 Nyanza et al conducted a longitudinal prospective study to examine the association between prenatal and maternal exposure to arsenic/mercury exposure and birth outcomes in mining communities. The group reported that women living in mining communities had higher blood levels of mercury than women who did not live in mining communities. Additionally, high levels of arsenic were associated with spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and preterm birth, whereas mercury exposure was associated with stillbirth solely [71]. Rowland, A. S., Baird, D. D., Shore, D. L., Darden, B., & Wilcox, A. J. (1996). Ethylene oxide exposure may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and postterm birth. Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.), 7(4), 363–368. https://doi.org/10.1097/00001648-199607000-00005 Rowland et al used a questionnaire to determine if exposure to ethylene oxide was associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. The group reported that exposure to this chemical may be associated with spontaneous abortion and preterm birth [104]. Santos, D., & Nascimento, L. (2019). Maternal exposure to benzene and toluene and preterm birth. A longitudinal study. Sao Paulo medical journal = Revista paulista de medicina, 137(6), 486–490. https://doi.org/10.1590/1516-3180.2019.0224170919 Santos et al investigated whether exposure to benzene and toluene among pregnant women contributes to preterm delivery. The group found that maternal exposure to benzene and toluene had an acute effect on preterm delivery [75]. Fibroids​ Jackson, L. W., Zullo, M. D., & Goldberg, J. M. (2008).

How can I reduce my exposure to harmful chemicals in my home? Use HEPA filters when vacuuming. Dust with wet cleaning cloths and use a wet mop. Change filters on heating and cooling units frequently. Maintain proper ventilation (e.g., open windows on days with good outdoor air quality). Wash hands frequently, especially before eating. Avoid purchasing products that contain harmful chemicals (see below). Get rid of older furniture that may contain flame retardants. How can I find products without harmful chemicals? Apparel Clothing and shoes advertised as water-resistant or stain-resistant may have PFAS chemicals. Check out our list of PFAS-free apparel, outdoor gear, and shoes. Avoid clothing advertised as “antimicrobial”, “antibacterial”, or “anti-odor”. Building insulation Avoid foam plastic insulation (polystyrene, polyisocyanurate, and polyurethane insulation), which contains flame retardants. Carpets and rugs Older carpets and rugs may contain PFAS for stain- and soil-repellency. Check out our list of PFAS-free carpets and rugs. Avoid using rebonded carpet padding made from recycled or scrap polyurethane foam, which may contain flame retardants. Children’s products Children’s products manufactured before 2015 may contain flame retardants added to the foam. These older products may have a TB 117 label. Most car seats contain flame retardants in the foam. Some car seats contain PFAS for stain- and soil-repellency. Check out our list of PFAS-free car seats. Avoid inexpensive metal jewelry or charms, which may contain cadmium or lead. Cleaning products Avoid products that are advertised as “antimicrobial” or “antibacterial.” Note that many soap brands are replacing antimicrobials like triclosan and triclocarban with problematic quats (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride) or chemicals with limited information on health impacts (e.g., chloroxylenol). Select eco-labelled cleaning products, such as the U.S. EPA’s “Safer Choice”. Furniture Furniture manufactured before 2015 may contain added flame retardants. Look for a TB 117-2013 label (with wording as on the right) that states whether or not furniture contains added flame retardants. Swap out the foam in your cushions with new flame-retardant free foam--or consider buying a new couch. See our fact sheet about buying furniture without flame retardants. Some furniture may contain PFAS for water- or stain-repellency. Check out our list of PFAS-free furniture. Kitchen products To avoid PFAS, purchase cast iron, glass, or ceramic cookware rather than Teflon. Check out our list of PFAS-free foodware. Avoid plastics marked with recycle codes 3 or 7 which may be made with bisphenols or phthalates. Avoid older hand (immersion) blenders which may leak chlorinated paraffin flame retardants. Avoid using black plastic kitchen utensils as these often contain flame retardants due to improper recycling of electronics plastics. Paints Use water-based, instead of oil-based, paints. Don’t use epoxies and resins containing bisphenols or harsh solvents. Personal care products (body washes, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc.) Avoid personal care products with “perfluor-“, “polyfluor-“, and “PTFE” on the label. Check out our list of PFAS-free personal care products. Avoid products that are advertised as “antimicrobial”, “antibacterial”, or “anti-odor”. Note that many personal care products are replacing antimicrobials like triclosan and triclocarban with problematic quats (e.g., benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride) or chemicals with limited information on health impacts (e.g., chloroxylenol). Look for fragrance-free personal care products, since the ingredients “fragrance”, “perfume”, or “parfum” often mean phthalates are present. Do not use imported skin lightening, acne treatment, or anti-aging creams unless you are certain that they do not contain mercury. How do I reduce exposure to toxic chemicals in my diet? Avoid food in contact with greaseproof packaging (which may have PFAS), such as microwave popcorn and some fast food. When possible, opt for glass, porcelain or stainless steel food containers and tableware, particularly for hot food or liquids. Avoid microwaving plastics. If your home has older faucets and pipes that may contain lead, use cold water for drinking or cooking. Eat more fresh food and less canned, packaged, and fast food. Avoid fish that are high in mercury (see this chart by the U.S. FDA) and avoid freshwater fish, which are often heavily contaminated with PFAS. To reduce arsenic in your diet, include alternatives to rice-based foods whenever possible. How do I reduce toxic chemicals in my drinking water? If you are concerned about PFAS in your drinking water, consider installing an in-home filter on your tap. EWG summarized what is known about the efficacy of the different filter options here . Ask your water provider if you have a lead service line providing water to your home. If you have a lead service line, ask if there are any programs to assist with removal of the lead service line going to your home. If lead is a concern, you can use a certified filter for all water you use for drinking or cooking. Many public water systems will test drinking water for residents upon request. There are also laboratories that can test for lead, PFAS, and other contaminants.",

Cancer and Complementary Health Approaches: What You Need To Know © Getty Images What’s the Bottom Line? Complementary health approaches may play a role in cancer care, but using them inappropriately can be harmful. For your safety: Don’t use unproven products or practices to replace or delay medical treatment for cancer. If you have cancer, consult your health care provider before adding any complementary health products or practices to your treatment program. What do we know about the usefulness of complementary approaches for cancer? No complementary health approach has been shown to prevent or cure cancer. Some complementary health approaches, such as acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga, may help manage cancer symptoms and side effects of treatment. What do we know about the safety of complementary approaches for cancer? Psychological and physical practices such as hypnosis, massage therapy, and yoga are usually safe when used appropriately. However, special precautions may need to be taken to make some of these practices safe for people with cancer. Some complementary health approaches can interfere with medical treatment for cancer. For example, some herbs may make chemotherapy drugs less effective. Some of the fraudulent cancer “cures” marketed via the internet are dangerous in themselves, and others can be harmful if people use them instead of seeking effective medical treatment. About Cancer Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Although cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, people with cancer are living longer because of improvements in early detection and treatment. About two out of every three people in the United States diagnosed with cancer will live at least 5 years after diagnosis. For more information about cancer, visit the National Cancer Institute (NCI) website . About Complementary Health Approaches Complementary health approaches are a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products whose origins come from outside of mainstream medicine . They include such products and practices as herbal supplements , other dietary supplements , meditation , spinal manipulation , and acupuncture . Complementary approaches can be classified by their primary therapeutic input (how the therapy is taken in or delivered), which may be: Nutritional (e.g., special diets, dietary supplements, herbs , probiotics , and microbial-based therapies) Psychological (e.g., meditation, hypnosis, music therapies, relaxation therapies) Physical (e.g., acupuncture, massage , spinal manipulation) Combinations such as psychological and physical (e.g., yoga , tai chi , dance therapies, some forms of art therapy) or psychological and nutritional (e.g., mindful eating) Nutritional approaches include what NCCIH previously categorized as natural products , whereas psychological and/or physical approaches include what was referred to as mind and body practices . This publication looks at complementary health approaches that have been studied for cancer prevention, treatment of the disease, or symptom management, including what the science says about their effectiveness and any concerns that have been raised about their safety. Incorporating Complementary Health Approaches Into Cancer Care The Society for Integrative Oncology has issued evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for health care providers to consider when incorporating complementary health approaches in the care of people with cancer. The guidelines state that, when used in addition to conventional therapies, some of these approaches help to control symptoms and enhance patients’ well-being. The guidelines warn, however, that unproven methods shouldn’t be used in place of conventional treatment because delayed treatment of cancer reduces the likelihood of a remission or cure. Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Symptoms and Treatment Side Effects Some complementary health approaches may help people manage cancer symptoms or the side effects of treatment. However, some approaches may interfere with conventional cancer treatment or have other risks. People who have been diagnosed with cancer should consult their health care providers before using any complementary health approach. Psychological and Physical Approaches Acupuncture Several evaluations of the evidence have concluded that acupuncture can help manage treatment-related nausea and vomiting in people with cancer. A 2020 combined analysis of 14 studies (920 participants) found that acupuncture was associated with significant reductions in cancer pain, both in studies where acupuncture was compared with sham (simulated) acupuncture and in studies where acupuncture was compared with no treatment. In two studies, the use of acupuncture or acupressure in addition to pain medicine helped people with cancer reduce their dose of pain medicine. A 2018 review of 10 studies (1,327 participants) showed that acupuncture may be more helpful than sham acupuncture or usual care in relieving cancer-related fatigue. Research on the effects of acupuncture on cancer-related hot flashes is limited. Complications from acupuncture are rare, as long as the acupuncturist uses sterile needles and proper procedures. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy weaken the immune system, so it’s especially important for acupuncturists to follow strict clean-needle procedures to reduce the risk of infection when treating people with cancer. More information on acupuncture Hypnosis Hypnosis may be helpful for pain caused by cancer itself or by procedures used in cancer care, for nausea and vomiting in people with breast cancer, and for anxiety and distress around surgical and medical procedures in both adults and children. It may also be helpful for hot flashes in women with breast cancer. Hypnosis is a safe technique when practiced by a trained, experienced, licensed health care provider. More information on hypnosis Massage Therapy Massage therapy, with or without aromatherapy (the use of essential oils), has been used to attempt to relieve pain, anxiety, and other symptoms in people with cancer. However, there is only limited evidence on whether it is beneficial. A 2021 review of 13 studies (1,100 participants) of various manual therapies, including but not limited to massage therapy, provided evidence for benefits on pain, physical function, and global well-being but not fatigue, nausea, anxiety, or depression. These results should be interpreted cautiously because a variety of different manual therapies and measurement techniques were included and because some studies included small numbers of participants or were of low quality. A 2016 evaluation of 19 studies (more than 1,200 participants) of massage for people with cancer found some evidence that massage might help with pain and anxiety, but the quality of the evidence was very low, and findings were not consistent. Massage therapists may need to modify their usual techniques when working with people with cancer; for example, they may have to use less pressure than usual in areas that are sensitive because of cancer or cancer treatments. More information on massage therapy Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction A 2020 review of 26 studies (3,476 participants) of people with various types of cancer showed that those who participated in mindfulness-based interventions had less anxiety, depression, fatigue, and stress, and a better quality of life than those who did not participate in mindfulness-based interventions. Mindfulness and other forms of meditation are generally considered to be safe for healthy people. However, they may need to be modified to make them safe and comfortable for people with some health conditions. For example, if you can’t sit still comfortably for long periods of time, your meditation instructor can adapt the meditation practice so that you don’t need to do this. More information on meditation and mindfulness Tai Chi and Qigong A 2020 review looked at 16 studies (1,268 participants) of tai chi in women with breast cancer. Some of the studies evaluated tai chi as an alternative to conventional supportive care interventions such as aerobic exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy, and others evaluated it as an addition to conventional care. Tai chi improved fatigue when used as an addition to conventional care (two studies) but not when used as an alternative to conventional care (two studies). Tai chi improved overall quality of life when used either as an addition to conventional care (four studies) or as an alternative to conventional care (two studies). A 2019 review of 12 recent studies (915 participants) of qigong or tai chi for patients with various types of cancer found favorable effects on symptoms of fatigue and sleep quality that were large enough to be meaningful to patients. Tai chi and qigong are generally considered to be safe practices. More information on tai chi and qigong Yoga A 2020 evaluation of 24 studies of yoga for women with breast cancer, involving a total of more than 1,600 participants, concluded that yoga provides small-to-moderate improvements in cancer-related fatigue and quality of life compared to interventions not involving physical activity. Therefore, it could be a supportive intervention for women with breast cancer, as an addition to standard treatment. A 2021 review of 26 studies of yoga-based interventions for depressive symptoms (1,486 participants) and 16 studies of yoga-based interventions for anxiety symptoms (977 participants) in people with various types of cancer found evidence that the interventions were helpful for both types of symptoms. The majority of the studies involved women with breast cancer. Yoga is generally considered a safe form of physical activity for healthy people when performed properly under the guidance of a qualified instructor. However, as with other forms of physical activity, injuries can occur. The most common injuries are sprains and strains. Serious injuries are rare. In studies of yoga in people with cancer, adverse events have mostly been minor. However, having an ongoing health problem such as cancer may increase the risks of doing yoga. If you have cancer, talk with your health care providers to find out whether any aspects of yoga might be unsafe for you. More information on yoga Nutritional Approaches Ginger Ginger is an herb that is sold as a dietary supplement. A 2019 evaluation of 18 studies with more than 1,600 participants concluded that the evidence on whether ginger is helpful for nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy is mixed. Some studies suggested that ginger helped to control nausea, but in other studies, ginger didn’t seem to have any effect. People diagnosed with cancer should consult their health care providers before taking ginger or any other dietary supplement. More information on ginger Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Treatment No complementary approach has been shown to cure cancer or cause it to go into remission. Some products or practices that have been advocated for cancer treatment may interfere with conventional cancer treatments or have other risks. If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer, you should consult your health care providers before using any complementary health approach. The following sections discuss a few products that have been promoted as cancer treatments. You can find information on additional products at the NCI website . Herbal Supplements Studies on whether herbal supplements or substances derived from them might be of value in cancer treatment are in their early stages, and scientific evidence is limited. Herbal supplements may have side effects, and some may interact in harmful ways with drugs, including those used in cancer treatment. Vitamin, Mineral, and Antioxidant Dietary Supplements The effects of taking vitamin and mineral dietary supplements, including antioxidant supplements, during cancer treatment are uncertain. Because these supplements might interfere with the effectiveness of chemotherapy or other cancer therapies, if you are being treated for cancer, you should discuss their use with your health care providers. Black Salves Products called black salves have been marketed for self-treatment of a variety of skin conditions, including skin cancer. Black salves are neither safe nor effective. When used to treat a skin cancer, black salve products may not remove all of it, which may allow the cancer to spread and become more serious. Also, black salves can destroy both cancerous and healthy skin. They can cause scarring and tissue damage, which is sometimes severe and disfiguring. Most black salve research involves case studies; well-controlled clinical trials have not been conducted. Laetrile Laetrile is another name for the natural substance amygdalin, a chemical constituent found in the pits of many fruits. A 2019 review of research on laetrile found no clinical evidence it is effective as a cancer treatment. Laetrile can have toxic effects. Intravenous Vitamin C Studies on the benefit of high-dose, intravenous vitamin C use for cancer have yielded varying results. Research in people is limited; most of the evidence is based on animal and laboratory research. The evidence is mixed for intravenous vitamin C’s impact on tumor growth or overall survival. Some studies have found an increase in quality of life and a decrease in cancer treatment–related toxicities, but the findings are not conclusive. Treatment with intravenous vitamin C generally seems to be well-tolerated and safe, but patients with certain conditions (e.g., iron overload, kidney disease) are at increased risk for serious toxicity. Curcumin Curcumin, a substance found in turmeric, has been studied for its possible effects on cancer development and progression. Because a variety of different products and dosages were tested, and because the studies were brief and included only small numbers of people, there isn’t enough evidence to recommend products that contain curcumin for the treatment of people with cancer. Researchers are studying curcumin’s usefulness for alleviating side effects caused by cancer treatment, such as oral mucositis and radiation-induced dermatitis (a skin rash caused by radiation treatment), as well as quality of life. Beware of Cancer Treatment Frauds The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public to beware of fraudulent cancer treatments promoted on websites or social media platforms. Some fraudulent cancer treatments are harmful by themselves, and others can be indirectly harmful because people may delay seeking medical care while they try them, or because the fraudulent product interferes with the effectiveness of proven cancer treatments. The people who sell fraudulent cancer treatments often market them with claims such as “treats all forms of cancer,” “cures cancer,” “selectively kills cancer cells,” or “more effective than chemotherapy.” If you’re considering using any anticancer product that you’ve seen in an advertisement, talk with your health care provider first. Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Prevention You can reduce your risk of cancer in several ways—including making healthy choices (such as avoiding tobacco and maintaining a healthy weight), getting recommended vaccines against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV), and getting appropriate cancer screening tests. Research has also been done to see whether various nutritional approaches might help to prevent cancer. Vitamin and Mineral Supplements The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force—an expert group that makes recommendations about the types of health care people should receive to prevent diseases—evaluated the evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements and cancer prevention in 2014. (A 2021 update to the report is underway and is anticipated to give the same advice.) The recommendations state that: You shouldn’t take vitamin E supplements to try to prevent cancer. Studies have shown that they don’t work. You shouldn’t take beta-carotene supplements to try to prevent cancer. Studies have shown that they don’t work, and they can harm some people, such as those who smoke tobacco. For all other vitamin and mineral supplements—including single vitamins or minerals, combinations such as calcium plus vitamin D, and multivitamins —there isn’t enough evidence to say whether they can help prevent cancer. The Task Force didn’t make a recommendation for or against the use of these supplements. Green Tea Studies of green tea and cancer in people have had inconsistent results. Based on current evidence, it isn’t possible to say whether green tea helps to prevent cancer. Green tea is believed to be safe when consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts. Liver problems have been reported in a small number of people who took concentrated green tea extracts. Experts suggest that green tea extracts should be taken with food, people with liver problems should not take green tea extracts, and users should discontinue use and consult a health care provider if they develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Other Nutritional Approaches Several other dietary supplements, including garlic, Ginkgo biloba, noni, and grape seed extract, have been investigated for possible cancer-preventive effects, but the evidence on these substances is too limited for any conclusions to be reached. In two large observational studies in which researchers kept track of people over a period of years, people who took glucosamine and chondroitin were less likely to develop colorectal cancer. Because these were observational studies, rather than trials in which people were randomly assigned to take a supplement or a placebo, the results can only provide clues for further research; they can’t prove a cause-and-effect relationship because other factors could be involved. National Institutes of Health Research on Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Some ongoing studies related to complementary approaches and cancer funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) or NCI are looking at: Whether panaxynol, a substance from American ginseng, can suppress colitis and thereby lower the risk of colon cancer The potential value of a multimodal mind and body intervention for reducing fear of cancer recurrence Self-administered hypnosis to manage hot flashes (which may be caused by breast cancer treatment) The potential value of yoga as a treatment for peripheral neuropathy, a painful side effect of some types of cancer chemotherapy More To Consider Gather information about the complementary health product or practice that interests you, and then discuss it with your health care providers. If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer, it’s especially important to talk with your health care providers before you start using any new complementary health approach. If you’re already using a complementary approach, tell your health care providers about it, even if your reason for using it has nothing to do with cancer. Here are examples of questions to ask: What is known about the benefits and risks of this product or practice? Do the benefits outweigh the risks? What are the potential side effects? Will this approach interfere with my cancer treatment? Can you refer me to a practitioner? Don’t use any health product or practice that has not been proven safe and effective to replace conventional cancer care or as a reason to postpone seeing your health care provider about any health problem. Take charge of your health—talk with your health care providers about any complementary health approaches you use. Together, you can make shared, well-informed decisions.

Foods low on the glycemic index (GI) scale tend to release glucose slowly and steadily. Foods high on the glycemic index release glucose rapidly. Low-GI foods tend to foster weight loss, while foods high on the GI scale help with energy recovery after exercise, or to offset hypo- (insufficient) glycemia.

Statistics tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year, the number of people who are currently living after a cancer diagnosis, the average age at diagnosis, and the numbers of people who are still alive at a given time after diagnosis. They also tell us about differences among groups defined by age, sex, racial/ethnic group, geographic location, and other categories. Cancer statistics also help us see trends. By looking at cancer rates over time, we can track changes in the risk of developing and dying from specific cancers as well as cancer overall. For information about chances of surviving cancer and prognosis , see Understanding Cancer Prognosis . NCI also has a collection of statistical summaries for a number of common cancer types . Although statistical trends are usually not directly applicable to individual patients, they are essential for governments, policy makers, health professionals, and researchers to understand the impact of cancer on the population and to develop strategies to address the challenges that cancer poses to the society at large. Statistical trends are also important for measuring the success of efforts to control and manage cancer. Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer in the United States In 2025, an estimated 2,041,910 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 618,120 people will die from the disease. The most common cancers (listed in descending order according to estimated new cases in 2025) are breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, colon and rectum cancer, melanoma of the skin, bladder cancer, kidney and renal pelvis cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, uterine corpus cancer, pancreatic cancer, leukemia, thyroid cancer, and liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer. Prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers account for an estimated 48% of all cancers diagnosed in men in 2025. For women, the three most common cancers are breast, lung, and colorectal, and they will account for an estimated 51% of all new cancer diagnoses in women in 2025. The rate of new cases of cancer (cancer incidence) is 445.8 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2018–2022 cases). The cancer death rate (cancer mortality) is 145.4 per 100,000 men and women per year (based on 2019–2023 deaths). The cancer mortality rate is higher among men than women (171.5 per 100,000 men and 126.3 per 100,000 women). When comparing groups based on race/ethnicity and sex, cancer mortality is highest in non-Hispanic Black men (203.6 per 100,000) and lowest in non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women (83.1 per 100,000). As of January 2022, there were an estimated 18.1 million cancer survivors in the United States. The number of cancer survivors is projected to increase to 26 million by 2040. Approximately 38.9% of men and women will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their lifetimes (based on 2018–2021 data, not including 2020, due to COVID). In 2025, an estimated 14,690 children and adolescents ages 0 to 19 will be diagnosed with cancer and 1,650 will die of the disease. Estimated national expenditures for cancer care in the United States in 2020 were $208.9 billion. In future years, costs are likely to increase as the population ages and more people have cancer. Costs are also likely to increase as new, and often more expensive, treatments are adopted as standards of care. Statistics at a Glance: The Burden of Cancer Worldwide Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2022, there were almost 20 million new cases and 9.7 million cancer-related deaths worldwide. By 2050, the number of new cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 33 million and the number of cancer-related deaths to 18.2 million. Generally, cancer rates are highest in countries whose populations have the highest life expectancy, education level, and standard of living. But for some cancer types, such as cervical cancer, the reverse is true, and the incidence rate is highest in countries in which the population ranks low on these measures. Source: International Agency for Research on Cancer U.S. Cancer Mortality Trends The best indicator of progress against cancer is a change in age-adjusted mortality (death) rates, although other measures, such as quality of life, are also important. Incidence is also important, but it is not always straightforward to interpret changes in incidence. A rise in incidence can reflect a real increase in disease occurrence, such as when an increase in exposure to a risk factor causes more cases of cancer. In such a scenario the increased incidence would likely lead to a rise in deaths from the cancer. On the other hand, the incidence of cancer may rise due to a new screening test that detects many cancer cases that would not have caused a problem during someone’s life (called overdiagnosis ). In this example, the incidence of the cancer would increase, but death rates would not change. Mortality trends, when compared with incidence trends, can also provide evidence of improved treatments. If death rates drop faster than incidence (or if death rates drop while incidence is rising), this may reflect the availability of better treatments. In the United States, the overall cancer death rate has declined since the early 1990s. The most recent Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer , released in April 2025, shows that overall cancer death rates decreased by: 1.7% per year among men from 2018 to 2022 1.3% per year among women from 2018 to 2022 1.5% per year among children ages 0–14 from 2001 to 2022 Although death rates for many individual cancer types have also declined, rates for a few cancers have not changed or even increased. As the overall cancer death rate has declined, the number of cancer survivors has increased. These trends show that progress is being made against the disease, but much work remains. Although rates of smoking, a major cause of cancer, have declined, the rates of other risk factors, such as obesity, have increased in the United States. Also, the U.S. population is aging, and cancer rates increase with age . The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program collects and publishes cancer incidence and survival data from population-based cancer registries that cover approximately 48% of the U.S. population. The SEER program website has more detailed cancer statistics, including population statistics for common types of cancer, customizable graphs and tables, and interactive tools. The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer provides an annual update of cancer incidence, mortality, and trends in the United States. This report is jointly authored by experts from NCI, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, American Cancer Society, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.

Skip to content Appointments at Mayo Clinic Mayo Clinic offers appointments in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota and at Mayo Clinic Health System locations. Request Appointment Products and services Chart of high-fiber foods By Mayo Clinic Staff If the goal is to add more fiber to your diet, there are lots of great options. Fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, peas and lentils all help you reach that daily fiber goal. Fiber-rich foods have a mix of different fiber types. Some fiber helps keep stool moving in the large intestine. Other types of fiber help a person feel full for longer. That can lower the overall calories consumed and help with weight control. And a diet rich in dietary fiber in general has been linked to lower levels of heart disease. The suggested amount of daily fiber depends on your age and how many calories you take in each day. Current dietary guidelines for Americans suggests that people age 2 and older get 14 grams of fiber for every 1,000 calories in the daily diet. For children ages 12 months through 23 months, the guidelines suggest getting 19 grams of fiber a day. In the charts below you'll find common foods and their amount of dietary fiber. Keep in mind: Check the label. When buying packaged foods, check the Nutrition Facts label for fiber content. It can vary among brands. Start slow. Adding too much fiber too quickly can result in intestinal gas, diarrhea, cramping and bloating. Consider increasing your fiber intake gradually over a few weeks. Drink fluids. As you eat more fiber, remember to drink plenty of fluids. Some fibers work best when they absorb water, so being well hydrated can help prevent uncomfortable bowel movements.

Source: USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Legacy Release All the foods listed are good options to boost your daily fiber amount. And some options can be combined, too. For example, 1 cup of raspberries added to 1 cup of cooked oatmeal with half a serving of almonds could provide about 13.5 grams of fiber. A bean and vegetable salad may provide about 11 grams of additional fiber. Together those two meal ideas supply most of the daily fiber goal for people who consume 2,000 calories a day. Combined or alone, these nutritious choices are some of the many options for boosting your fiber intake.

    "content": "Bacon, Hot Dogs and Lunch Meat - Is it Processed Meat? - American Institute for Cancer Research % Today, the World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) named processed meat as a carcinogen. AICR has included avoiding processed meat as one of our recommendations for cancer prevention since 2007. Processed meat (and high amounts of red meat) increase risk for colorectal cancer. Here’s our statement on the WHO report . Both organizations found that for processed meat, even small amounts eaten daily – 50 grams or 1 small hot dog – increases risk for colorectal cancer by 18% compared to eating none. So what exactly is “processed meat”? AICR defines processed meat as: “meat preserved by smoking, curing or salting, or addition of chemical preservatives.” Ham, bacon, pastrami, sausages, hot dogs and cold cuts are all considered processed meat. IARC’s definition: “meat that has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processing to enhance flavor or improve preservation. Most processed meats contain pork or beef, but processed meat may also contain other red meats and poultry” Grilling burgers and hot dogs It’s not yet clear exactly why these meats increase risk for colorectal cancer. It may be the added nitrites and nitrates, the smoking and/or high temperatures used in some processing, or the heme iron in red meat. Does this include nitrate and nitrite free meats and sausage? These products are relatively new, so we need more studies that make these distinctions. So, for now, save processed meats for special occasions and choose fresh meats most of the time. Here are some ideas to lower your cancer risk: Replace deli meats and cold cuts with fresh chicken or fish Instead of bacon, chorizo or salami, try spicy vegetarian sausages. Replace sausage in chili and soups with beans like kidney beans, chickpeas and lentils. Try out different sources of protein like eggs, cottage cheese, tofu and hummus IARC has also listed red meat as a probable carcinogen. AICR’s recommendation for red meat is to keep your red meat to less than 18 ounces (cooked) per week. That’s about 4 hamburgers (quarter-pounders) weekly.

    "title": "Cancer: Carcinogenicity of the consumption of red meat and processed meat",
    "url": "https://www.who.int/features/qa/cancer-red-meat/en/",
    "content": "Cancer: Carcinogenicity of the consumption of red meat and processed meat Skip to main content What do you consider as red meat? Red meat refers to all mammalian muscle meat, including, beef, veal, pork, lamb, mutton, horse, and goat. What do you consider as processed meat? Processed meat refers to meat that has been transformed through salting, curing, fermentation, smoking, or other processes to enhance flavour or improve preservation. Most processed meats contain pork or beef, but processed meats may also contain other red meats, poultry, offal, or meat by-products such as blood. Examples of processed meat include hot dogs (frankfurters), ham, sausages, corned beef, and biltong or beef jerky as well as canned meat and meat-based preparations and sauces. Why did IARC choose to evaluate red meat and processed meat? An international advisory committee that met in 2014 recommended red meat and processed meat as high priorities for evaluation by the IARC Monographs Programme. This recommendation was based on epidemiological studies suggesting that small increases in the risk of several cancers may be associated with high consumption of red meat or processed meat. Although these risks are small, they could be important for public health because many people worldwide eat meat and meat consumption is increasing in low- and middle-income countries. Although some health agencies already recommend limiting intake of meat, these recommendations are aimed mostly at reducing the risk of other diseases. With this in mind, it was important for IARC to provide authoritative scientific evidence on the cancer risks associated with eating red meat and processed meat. What are the safest methods of cooking meat (e.g. sautéing, boiling, broiling, or barbecuing)? Cooking at high temperatures or with the food in direct contact with a flame or a hot surface, as in barbecuing or pan-frying, produces more of certain types of carcinogenic chemicals (such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic aromatic amines). However, there were not enough data for the IARC Working Group to reach a conclusion about whether the way meat is cooked affects the risk of cancer. Is eating raw meat safer? There were no data to address this question in relation to cancer risk. However, the separate question of risk of infection from consumption of raw meat needs to be kept in mind. Red meat was classified as Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean exactly? In the case of red meat, the classification is based on limited evidence from epidemiological studies showing positive associations between eating red meat and developing colorectal cancer as well as strong mechanistic evidence. Limited evidence means that a positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent and cancer but that other explanations for the observations (technically termed chance, bias, or confounding) could not be ruled out. Processed meat was classified as Group 1, carcinogenic to humans. What does this mean? This category is used when there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. In other words, there is convincing evidence that the agent causes cancer. The evaluation is usually based on epidemiological studies showing the development of cancer in exposed humans. In the case of processed meat, this classification is based on sufficient evidence from epidemiological studies that eating processed meat causes colorectal cancer. Processed meat was classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Tobacco smoking and asbestos are also both classified as carcinogenic to humans(Group 1). Does it mean that consumption of processed meat is as carcinogenic as tobacco smoking and asbestos? No, processed meat has been classified in the same category as causes of cancer such as tobacco smoking and asbestos (IARC Group 1, carcinogenic to humans), but this does NOT mean that they are all equally dangerous. The IARC classifications describe the strength of the scientific evidence about an agent being a cause of cancer, rather than assessing the level of risk. What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating red meat? The strongest, but still limited, evidence for an association with eating red meat is for colorectal cancer. There is also evidence of links with pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer. What types of cancers are linked or associated with eating processed meat? The IARC Working Group concluded that eating processed meat causes colorectal cancer. An association with stomach cancer was also seen, but the evidence is not conclusive. How many cancer cases every year can be attributed to consumption of processed meat and red meat? According to the most recent estimates by the Global Burden of Disease Project, an independent academic research organization, about 34 000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are attributable to diets high in processed meat. Eating red meat has not yet been established as a cause of cancer. However, if the reported associations were proven to be causal, the Global Burden of Disease Project has estimated that diets high in red meat could be responsible for 50 000 cancer deaths per year worldwide. These numbers contrast with about 1 million cancer deaths per year globally due to tobacco smoking, 600 000 per year due to alcohol consumption, and more than 200 000 per year due to air pollution. Could you quantify the risk of eating red meat and processed meat? The consumption of processed meat was associated with small increases in the risk of cancer in the studies reviewed. In those studies, the risk generally increased with the amount of meat consumed. An analysis of data from 10 studies estimated that every 50 gram portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by about 18%. The cancer risk related to the consumption of red meat is more difficult to estimate because the evidence that red meat causes cancer is not as strong. However, if the association of red meat and colorectal cancer were proven to be causal, data from the same studies suggest that the risk of colorectal cancer could increase by 17% for every 100 gram portion of red meat eaten daily. Is the risk higher in children, in elderly people, in women, or in men? Are some people more at risk? The available data did not allow conclusions about whether the risks differ in different groups of people. What about people who have had colon cancer? Should they stop eating red meat? The available data did not allow conclusions about risks to people who have already had cancer. Should I stop eating meat? Eating meat has known health benefits. Many national health recommendations advise people to limit intake of processed meat and red meat, which are linked to increased risks of death from heart disease, diabetes, and other illnesses. How much meat is it safe to eat? The risk increases with the amount of meat consumed, but the data available for evaluation did not permit a conclusion about whether a safe level exists. What is WHO’s health recommendation to prevent cancer risk associated with eating red meat and processed meat? IARC is a research organization that evaluates the evidence available on the causes of cancer but does not make health recommendations as such. National governments and WHO are responsible for developing nutritional guidelines. This evaluation by IARC reinforces a 2002 recommendation from WHO that people who eat meat should moderate the consumption of processed meat to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer. Some other dietary guidelines also recommend limiting consumption of red meat or processed meat, but these are focused mainly on reducing the intake of fat and sodium, which are risk factors for cardiovascular disease and obesity. Individuals who are concerned about cancer could consider reducing their consumption of red meat or processed meat until updated guidelines related specifically to cancer have been developed. Should we eat only poultry and fish? The cancer risks associated with consumption of poultry and fish were not evaluated. Should we be vegetarians? Vegetarian diets and diets that include meat have different advantages and disadvantages for health. However, this evaluation did not directly compare health risks in vegetarians and people who eat meat. That type of comparison is difficult because these groups can be different in other ways besides their consumption of meat. Is there a type of red meat that is safer? A few studies have investigated the cancer risks associated with different types of red meat, such as beef and pork, and with different kinds of processed meats, like ham and hot dogs. However, there is not enough information to say whether higher or lower cancer risks are related to eating any particular type of red meat or processed meat. Could the preservation method influence the risk (e.g. salting, deep-freezing, or irradiation)? Different preservation methods could result in the formation of carcinogens (e.g. N-nitroso compounds), but whether and how much this contributes to the cancer risk is unknown. How many studies were evaluated? The IARC Working Group considered more than 800 different studies on cancer in humans (some studies provided data on both types of meat; in total more than 700 epidemiological studies provided data on red meat and more than 400 epidemiological studies provided data on processed meat). How many experts were involved in the evaluation? The IARC Working Group consisted of 22 experts from 10 countries. What actions do you think governments should take based on your results? IARC is a research organization that evaluates the evidence on the causes of cancer but does not make health recommendations as such. The IARC Monographs are, however, often used as a basis for making national and international policies, guidelines and recommendations to minimize cancer risks. Governments may decide to include this new information on the cancer hazards of processed meat in the context of other health risks and benefits in updating dietary recommendations.

Aromatherapy may be used with other complementary treatments, such as massage or acupuncture , as well as with standard medical treatments to manage symptoms caused by cancer or cancer treatment (see Question 1 ). Essential oils are most often used by inhaling them or by applying a diluted form of them to the skin (see Question 2 ). Aromatherapy research with cancer patients has studied the effect of essential oils on anxiety , nausea , vomiting , and other health-related conditions (see Question 4 ). Safety testing on essential oils has found very few side effects . Lavender and tea tree essential oils have been found to have some hormone -like effects (see Question 5 ). Aromatherapy products do not need approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (see Question 6 ). Questions and Answers About Aromatherapy What is aromatherapy? Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants to improve the mind, body, and spirit. It is used by patients with cancer to improve quality of life and reduce stress , anxiety , pain, nausea , and vomiting caused by cancer and its treatment. Aromatherapy is often used with other complementary treatments like massage therapy and acupuncture , as well as with standard medical treatments , for symptom management . Essential oils are the fragrant ( aromatic ) part found in many plants, often under the surface of leaves, bark, or peel. The fragrance is released if the plant is crushed or a special steam process is used. There are many essential oils used in aromatherapy, including those from Roman chamomile , geranium , lavender , tea tree , lemon , ginger , cedarwood , and bergamot . Each plant's essential oil has a different chemical make-up that affects how it smells, how it is absorbed, and how it affects the body. Essential oils are very concentrated. For example, it takes about 220 pounds of lavender flowers to make about 1 pound of essential oil. The aroma of essential oils fades away quickly when left open to air. The chemical compounds in essential oils can change as they get older. Many essential oils do not have an expiration date. How is aromatherapy given or taken? Aromatherapy is used in several ways. Indirect inhalation : The patient breathes in an essential oil by using a room diffuser , which spreads the essential oil through the air, or by placing drops on a tissue or piece of cotton nearby. Direct inhalation: The patient breathes in an essential oil by using an individual inhaler made by floating essential oil drops on top of hot water. Massage: In aromatherapy massage , one or more essential oils is diluted into a carrier oil and massaged into the skin. Essential oils may also be mixed with bath salts and lotions or applied to bandages. There are some essential oils used to treat specific conditions . However, the types of essential oils used and the ways they are combined vary, depending on the experience and training of the aromatherapist . Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been done using aromatherapy? In laboratory studies , tumor cells are used to test a substance to find out if it is likely to have any anticancer effects. In animal studies , tests are done to see if a drug , procedure, or treatment is safe and effective in animals. Laboratory and animal studies are done before a substance is tested in people. Laboratory and animal studies have tested the effects of essential oils. For information on laboratory and animal studies done using essential oils, see the Laboratory/Animal/Preclinical Studies section of the health professional version of Aromatherapy With Essential Oils. Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of aromatherapy been done? Clinical trials of aromatherapy have studied its use in the treatment of anxiety, nausea, vomiting, and other health-related conditions in cancer patients. No studies of aromatherapy used to treat cancer have been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal . Studies of aromatherapy have shown mixed results. There have been some reports of improved mood, anxiety, sleep, nausea, and pain. Other studies reported that aromatherapy showed no change in symptoms . Studies on anxiety and depression A trial of 103 cancer patients studied the effects of massage compared to massage with Roman chamomile essential oil. Two weeks later, a decrease in anxiety and improved symptoms were noted in the group that had massage with essential oil. The group that had massage only did not have the same benefit. Another study of 58 patients with various cancers who completed six aromatherapy sessions showed a decrease in anxiety and depression compared with before the sessions began. A randomized controlled trial studied the effects of inhalation aromatherapy on anxiety during radiation therapy . There were 313 patients randomly assigned to either lavender, bergamot, or cedarwood essential oils. There were no differences reported in depression or anxiety between the groups. Study on sleep Newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia who were hospitalized to receive intensive chemotherapy inhaled an essential oil through a diffuser overnight for 3 weeks. Patients were given the choice of lavender, peppermint, or chamomile . Improvement was reported in sleep, tiredness, drowsiness, lack of appetite , depression, anxiety, and well-being. Study on dry mouth Radioactive iodine may cause damage to salivary glands . Increased saliva production during treatment may decrease damage to salivary glands. In a randomized controlled trial, patients who inhaled a mixture of lemon and ginger essential oils had increased saliva production compared with the placebo group. Studies on nausea and vomiting A study of inhaled ginger essential oil in women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer somewhat decreased acute nausea, but did not lessen vomiting or chronic nausea. In a study of adult patients at the time of stem cell infusion, tasting or sniffing sliced oranges was more effective at reducing nausea, retching , and coughing than inhaling an orange essential oil. Study on aromatherapy in children Aromatherapy is used or claimed to be useful for a variety of childhood symptoms and conditions. When used safely, aromatherapy can help children feel calmer and sleep better. A study of aromatherapy inhaled by children and adolescents undergoing stem cell transplant infusions compared essential oil from the peel of bergamot (a type of orange from trees grown in Italy) with a pleasant-smelling shampoo that did not contain essential oils. Bergamot oil is used in aromatherapy to relieve depression, anxiety, and poor digestion . The placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized trial in 37 children and adolescents found that aromatherapy was not effective in reducing nausea, anxiety, or pain. Studies on procedure-related symptoms Women having breast biopsies were randomly assigned to receive lavender-sandalwood or orange-peppermint essential oil drops placed on a felt tab and attached to their hospital gown or to no scent on the felt tab. Women who received the lavender-sandalwood aromatherapy tab had less anxiety than women who received the orange-peppermint aromatherapy tab or no scent tab. In a study of inhaled lavender essential oil, eucalyptus essential oil, or no essential oil in cancer patients having needles inserted into a central venous port catheter , patients who inhaled lavender essential oil reported less pain. A randomized controlled trial compared aromatherapy, music therapy , a combination of both, or a placebo in women with breast cancer before and after they had a mastectomy . The aromatherapy group received a mixture of lavender, bergamot, and geranium essential oils, while the music group was given a choice of music styles. The combination of treatments was found to be more effective in lessening pain and anxiety than either treatment alone. Have any side effects or risks been reported from aromatherapy? Safety testing on essential oils shows very few side effects or risks when they are used as directed. Most essential oils have been approved as ingredients in food and fragrances and are labeled as GRAS (generally recognized as safe) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Swallowing large amounts of essential oils is not recommended. Allergic reactions and skin irritation may occur when essential oils are in contact with the skin for long periods of time. Sun sensitivity may occur when citrus or other essential oils are applied to the skin before going out in the sun. Lavender and tea tree essential oils have been found to have effects similar to estrogen (female sex hormone ) and also block or decrease the effect of androgens (male sex hormones). Applying lavender and tea tree essential oils to the skin over a long period of time was linked in one study to breast growth in boys who had not yet reached puberty . Is aromatherapy approved by the FDA for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? Aromatherapy products do not need FDA approval. Aromatherapy is not regulated by state law, and there is no licensing required to practice aromatherapy in the United States. Practitioners often combine aromatherapy training with another field in which they are licensed, for example, massage therapy, nursing, acupuncture, or naturopathy . The National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy ( www.naha.org ) and the Alliance of International Aromatherapists ( www.alliance-aromatherapists.org ) are two organizations that have national educational standards for aromatherapists. A list of schools that offer certificate programs approved by NAHA can be found at https://naha.org/index.php/education/approved-schools/ . The Canadian Federation of Aromatherapists ( www.cfacanada.com ) certifies aromatherapists in Canada. For a list of international aromatherapy programs, see the International Federation of Aromatherapists website ( www.ifaroma.org/ ).

About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in Spanish . PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government’s center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of aromatherapy with essential oils in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board . Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at NCI's website .

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)—also called integrative medicine—includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM Therapies It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment—not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. The NCI Best Case Series Program which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI’s Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients’ medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: What side effects can be expected? What are the risks related to this therapy? What benefits can be expected from this therapy? Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? Will the therapy be covered by health insurance? To Learn More About CAM National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) facilitates research and evaluation of complementary and alternative practices, and provides information about a variety of approaches to health professionals and the public.

Aromatherapy © Thinkstock Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants (flowers, herbs, or trees) as a complementary health approach. The essential oils are most often used by inhaling them or by applying a diluted form to the skin. Many essential oils are used in aromatherapy, including those from Roman chamomile, geranium, lavender, tea tree, lemon, ginger, cedarwood, and bergamot. Aromatherapy is sometimes used for insomnia, but we don’t know whether it’s helpful because little rigorous research has been done on this topic. Aromatherapy is sometimes incorporated into massage therapy for various conditions, such as knee pain from osteoarthritis or pain, anxiety, and other symptoms in people with cancer. One study of aromatherapy using two contrasting scents, lemon and lavender, in people under stress found that lemon had a positive effect on mood but neither scent affected stress indicators, biochemical markers of immune system changes, or pain control.

Medically reviewed by Sade Meeks, MS, RD — Written by Sarah Garone — Updated on May 8, 2023 A processed food is simply one that has been altered from its original form. Learn how to tell the difference and food swaps you can make. Share on Pinterest Royalty Free When it comes to the grocery store, the aisles of processed foods are almost synonymous with “skip this area.” And because you’ve probably heard that you should limit consumption of these foods, there’s likely no need for a refresher on why it’s recommended. Lately, however, you may have seen a new term tossed around in nutrition news: “ultra-processed foods.” This category of food is making headlines as recent research connects it with major health risks. So, what’s the difference between ‘regular’ processed foods and ‘ultra’-processed foods? And what does that mean for your health? By definition, a processed food is simply one that has been altered from its original form. The International Food Information Council defines processing as “any deliberate change in a food that occurs before it is ready for us to eat.” Heating, pasteurizing, canning, and drying are all considered forms of processing. Some definitions even include refrigeration in the mix. So, unless we’re plucking apples directly off a tree or drinking milk straight from a cow, the vast majority of foods we eat are technically processed. But basic preparation and preservation techniques certainly don’t turn wholesome foods (such as whole grains and frozen vegetables) into “junk.” Just because something has gone through a process doesn’t mean it’s unhealthy to eat. Perhaps, then, it’s time to rethink our mentality about processed foods and direct more attention to so-called ultra-processed foods. After all, timely research suggests ultra-processed foods specifically can cause health problems, including increased risk of obesity and cancer . But the parameters around ultra-processed foods are less clear than those around processed food in general. Exactly what this term refers to depends on who is being asked. The idea of ultra-processed foods was first introduced by a Brazilian nutrition researcher, Carlos A. Monteiro, in a 2009 paper . Then in 2010 , Monteiro and a team of Brazilian researchers went a step further and broke processed foods into a classification system, which is now called NOVA . On one end of the NOVA spectrum are unprocessed or minimally processed items such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and eggs — foods you might see included on the Whole30 diet or Mediterranean diet . On the other end are ultra-processed foods, defined as “industrial formulations with five or more ingredients.” Since that 2018 study, other studies on the effects of ultra-processed foods have used different definitions of them. It seems there’s no single accepted set of criteria. “I would love to say there is consensus on the definitions of processed and ultra-processed foods,” says Carrie Gabriel , a registered dietitian nutritionist, “but I’ve seen plenty of arguments on what qualifies as one or the other.” In essence, pinning down the exact nature of ultra-processed food is still, well, in process. Despite this problem of semantics, some common features shape the concept of ultra-processed foods By most definitions, the changes that turn a “regular” processed food into an ultra-processed food occur in the final stage of food production, called tertiary processing. Typical food processing happens in different stages. Understanding these stages can help you independently determine how processed a food is and what your standards are. The primary stage involves basic preparations such as removal of inedible parts of the grain, cleaning cereals, and parboiling. Secondary processing includes baking, freezing, fermentation, and frying. The third stage turns the grains into edible products. In short, ultra-processed foods are probably what many of us already think of simply as processed foods — those shiny, packaged, nothing-to-do-with-nature products found at fast-food restaurants and gas station mini-marts. Like the NOVA classification system, many authorities agree that a long list of ingredients is a primary indicator of an ultra-processed food. A 2016 study examining how common they are in the American diet called them formulations that “besides salt, sugar, oils, and fats, include substances not used in culinary preparations.” The study authors went on to include anything that used additives to imitate the qualities of “real” foods. “I like the definition as being the addition of sugar, salt, oils, and fats to aid in flavor and preservation,” Gabriel says. Though they may add flavor and texture, all these “extras” are likely to increase our risk for health conditions. Excess sugar, salt, and oils in the diet are known to play a role in the development of numerous health conditions. Limiting processed foods is already something we know Understanding how foods become ultra-processed can be a helpful step in remembering to minimize your intake of those foods. Diligent label reading can also help you choose products with fewer ingredients. Cooking at home goes a long way toward reducing consumption of ultra-processed foods. Restaurants (especially fast-food restaurants) are notorious for tinkering with their recipes to achieve a certain flavor, which could involve using less-than-nutrient-dense ingredients. However, in some cases , getting unprocessed, whole food isn’t that simple, whether it’s an issue of affordability, availability, or accessibility. Still, you can likely make small changes to tweak the amount of ultra-processed foods in your diet. Here’s a chart to help you make some nutritious swaps: sweetened breakfast cereals plain bran cereal oat groats or steel-cut oats sweetened with honey soda artificially flavored sparkling water water with a splash of fruit juice or fruit slices flavored potato chips plain tortilla chips DIY pita chips white bread whole wheat bread with minimal ingredients homemade wheat bread fried chicken deli rotisserie chicken roast chicken from scratch flavored candy bar with long ingredient list simple candy bar with short ingredient list dark chocolate squares frozen, blended coffee drink store-bought cold brew drip coffee mashed potato flakes frozen potatoes fresh, whole potatoes energy drink sweetened fruit juice fresh-squeezed orange juice flavored granola bars with added sugar and preservatives granola bars with minimal additives DIY granola artificially flavored cheese crackers naturally flavored crackers apple and cheese slices Thanks to years of exposure to diet culture, we have already read about which foods have been socially labeled as “bad” and “good.” But it’s really not that simple. Attaching positive or negative labels to foods hasn’t necessarily changed what we consume. Food is more than fuel and filler — it’s a relationship. So, the next time you head to the grocery store, remember that not all “processed” foods are necessarily bad for you. Focus on consuming more fruits and vegetables, whether fresh, frozen, or canned. Read labels and add foods to your shopping cart that have ingredient lists of things you recognize. Limit items that are in high in added sugar and sodium. The American Heart Association recommends that men consume no more than about 9 teaspoons of added sugar, or 36 grams, per day and women aim for no more than 6 teaspoons, or 25 grams, per day. And ultra-processed foods? When you already know they’re not the best for you, it’s going to be about quantity, not quality, and comfort over health. The best step is to do a check-in with your mind and gut before putting something in your shopping cart. Sarah Garone, NDTR, is a nutritionist, freelance health writer, and food blogger.

    "content": "What is ultra-processed food? | Heart and Stroke Foundation Share Facebook Twitter Email Print People in Canada consume almost 50% of their daily calories from ultra-processed foods, according to research funded by Heart & Stroke. That means almost half of the food we eat every day has been significantly changed from its original state, with salt, sugar, fat, additives, preservatives and/or artificial colours added. What we eat has a big impact on our health. In fact, over one third of deaths from heart disease and stroke can be attributed to consumption of ultra-processed foods, according to a new study . Ultra-processed foods like candy, soft drinks, pizza and chips do not contain enough of the beneficial nutrients that the body requires. The more ultra-processed foods we eat, the poorer the overall nutritional quality of our diet. But here’s the good news. Not every food that comes in a box is ultra-processed. Confused? I was too. But this list really helped me out. It’s a classification system called NOVA that was developed by an international panel of food scientists and researchers. It splits foods into four categories: Unprocessed or minimally processed foods : Think vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, nuts, meats, seafood, herbs, spices, garlic, eggs and milk. Make these real, whole foods the basis of your diet. Processed foods : When ingredients such as oil, sugar or salt are added to foods and they are packaged, the result is processed foods. Examples are simple bread, cheese, tofu, and canned tuna or beans. These foods have been altered, but not in a way that’s detrimental to health. They are convenient and help you build nutritious meals. See? Not everything in a package is bad for you! Ultra-processed foods : Here’s the category where almost 50% of our calories come from – and where we should cut back. These foods go through multiple processes (extrusion, molding, milling, etc.), contain many added ingredients and are highly manipulated. Examples are soft drinks, chips, chocolate, candy, ice-cream, sweetened breakfast cereals, packaged soups, chicken nuggets, hotdogs, fries and more. How can I cut back on ultra-processed foods? Cook more often : One major change in dietary patterns in the last 70 years has been the decline of home cooked meals, and the increase in ultra-processed foods. Tip the balance! Cook at home more often, without using ultra-processed ingredients (heating up frozen fried chicken doesn’t count). Dine with friends and family : Real food, real talk, good company. That’s a winning combination for dinner – and studies show that people who dine together have better eating habits, such as enjoying more vegetables, fewer soft drinks, and less deep-fried food. Studies show that people who dine together have better eating habits. Dine out on better choices : Restaurant meals can be fresh and healthy; they don’t need to be ultra-processed options. Challenge yourself to fill half your plate with vegetables wherever you dine, and choose items that are baked, poached, stir-fried or grilled rather than deep-fried. Consider the source : Think about where your food comes from. As in, a steak comes from a cow and apples grow on trees. If you have trouble figuring out where a food originated because it has been so highly manipulated, consider if it nourishes your body at all. It probably doesn’t. Don’t be swayed by hype : Be wary of deceptive food marketing and advertising. Ultra-processed foods are often marketed as “healthy,” “natural” and “organic.” While these words may describe the original ingredients, they don’t refer to the process of how the food was made. So it’s buyer beware. Remember, an organic, natural cookie is still an ultra-processed food! Eating fresh, unprocessed, whole food will do a lot of good for your body – including reducing your risk for high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke.

Cancer and Complementary Health Approaches: What You Need To Know © Getty Images What’s the Bottom Line? Complementary health approaches may play a role in cancer care, but using them inappropriately can be harmful. For your safety: Don’t use unproven products or practices to replace or delay medical treatment for cancer. If you have cancer, consult your health care provider before adding any complementary health products or practices to your treatment program. What do we know about the usefulness of complementary approaches for cancer? No complementary health approach has been shown to prevent or cure cancer. Some complementary health approaches, such as acupuncture, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga, may help manage cancer symptoms and side effects of treatment. What do we know about the safety of complementary approaches for cancer? Psychological and physical practices such as hypnosis, massage therapy, and yoga are usually safe when used appropriately. However, special precautions may need to be taken to make some of these practices safe for people with cancer. Some complementary health approaches can interfere with medical treatment for cancer. For example, some herbs may make chemotherapy drugs less effective. Some of the fraudulent cancer “cures” marketed via the internet are dangerous in themselves, and others can be harmful if people use them instead of seeking effective medical treatment. About Cancer Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body. Although cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, people with cancer are living longer because of improvements in early detection and treatment. About two out of every three people in the United States diagnosed with cancer will live at least 5 years after diagnosis. For more information about cancer, visit the National Cancer Institute (NCI) website . About Complementary Health Approaches Complementary health approaches are a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products whose origins come from outside of mainstream medicine . They include such products and practices as herbal supplements , other dietary supplements , meditation , spinal manipulation , and acupuncture . Complementary approaches can be classified by their primary therapeutic input (how the therapy is taken in or delivered), which may be: Nutritional (e.g., special diets, dietary supplements, herbs , probiotics , and microbial-based therapies) Psychological (e.g., meditation, hypnosis, music therapies, relaxation therapies) Physical (e.g., acupuncture, massage , spinal manipulation) Combinations such as psychological and physical (e.g., yoga , tai chi , dance therapies, some forms of art therapy) or psychological and nutritional (e.g., mindful eating) Nutritional approaches include what NCCIH previously categorized as natural products , whereas psychological and/or physical approaches include what was referred to as mind and body practices . This publication looks at complementary health approaches that have been studied for cancer prevention, treatment of the disease, or symptom management, including what the science says about their effectiveness and any concerns that have been raised about their safety. Incorporating Complementary Health Approaches Into Cancer Care The Society for Integrative Oncology has issued evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for health care providers to consider when incorporating complementary health approaches in the care of people with cancer. The guidelines state that, when used in addition to conventional therapies, some of these approaches help to control symptoms and enhance patients’ well-being. The guidelines warn, however, that unproven methods shouldn’t be used in place of conventional treatment because delayed treatment of cancer reduces the likelihood of a remission or cure. Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Symptoms and Treatment Side Effects Some complementary health approaches may help people manage cancer symptoms or the side effects of treatment. However, some approaches may interfere with conventional cancer treatment or have other risks. People who have been diagnosed with cancer should consult their health care providers before using any complementary health approach. Psychological and Physical Approaches Acupuncture Several evaluations of the evidence have concluded that acupuncture can help manage treatment-related nausea and vomiting in people with cancer. A 2020 combined analysis of 14 studies (920 participants) found that acupuncture was associated with significant reductions in cancer pain, both in studies where acupuncture was compared with sham (simulated) acupuncture and in studies where acupuncture was compared with no treatment. In two studies, the use of acupuncture or acupressure in addition to pain medicine helped people with cancer reduce their dose of pain medicine. A 2018 review of 10 studies (1,327 participants) showed that acupuncture may be more helpful than sham acupuncture or usual care in relieving cancer-related fatigue. Research on the effects of acupuncture on cancer-related hot flashes is limited. Complications from acupuncture are rare, as long as the acupuncturist uses sterile needles and proper procedures. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy weaken the immune system, so it’s especially important for acupuncturists to follow strict clean-needle procedures to reduce the risk of infection when treating people with cancer. More information on acupuncture Hypnosis Hypnosis may be helpful for pain caused by cancer itself or by procedures used in cancer care, for nausea and vomiting in people with breast cancer, and for anxiety and distress around surgical and medical procedures in both adults and children. It may also be helpful for hot flashes in women with breast cancer. Hypnosis is a safe technique when practiced by a trained, experienced, licensed health care provider. More information on hypnosis Massage Therapy Massage therapy, with or without aromatherapy (the use of essential oils), has been used to attempt to relieve pain, anxiety, and other symptoms in people with cancer. However, there is only limited evidence on whether it is beneficial. A 2021 review of 13 studies (1,100 participants) of various manual therapies, including but not limited to massage therapy, provided evidence for benefits on pain, physical function, and global well-being but not fatigue, nausea, anxiety, or depression. These results should be interpreted cautiously because a variety of different manual therapies and measurement techniques were included and because some studies included small numbers of participants or were of low quality. A 2016 evaluation of 19 studies (more than 1,200 participants) of massage for people with cancer found some evidence that massage might help with pain and anxiety, but the quality of the evidence was very low, and findings were not consistent. Massage therapists may need to modify their usual techniques when working with people with cancer; for example, they may have to use less pressure than usual in areas that are sensitive because of cancer or cancer treatments. More information on massage therapy Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction A 2020 review of 26 studies (3,476 participants) of people with various types of cancer showed that those who participated in mindfulness-based interventions had less anxiety, depression, fatigue, and stress, and a better quality of life than those who did not participate in mindfulness-based interventions. Mindfulness and other forms of meditation are generally considered to be safe for healthy people. However, they may need to be modified to make them safe and comfortable for people with some health conditions. For example, if you can’t sit still comfortably for long periods of time, your meditation instructor can adapt the meditation practice so that you don’t need to do this. More information on meditation and mindfulness Tai Chi and Qigong A 2020 review looked at 16 studies (1,268 participants) of tai chi in women with breast cancer. Some of the studies evaluated tai chi as an alternative to conventional supportive care interventions such as aerobic exercise and cognitive behavioral therapy, and others evaluated it as an addition to conventional care. Tai chi improved fatigue when used as an addition to conventional care (two studies) but not when used as an alternative to conventional care (two studies). Tai chi improved overall quality of life when used either as an addition to conventional care (four studies) or as an alternative to conventional care (two studies). A 2019 review of 12 recent studies (915 participants) of qigong or tai chi for patients with various types of cancer found favorable effects on symptoms of fatigue and sleep quality that were large enough to be meaningful to patients. Tai chi and qigong are generally considered to be safe practices. More information on tai chi and qigong Yoga A 2020 evaluation of 24 studies of yoga for women with breast cancer, involving a total of more than 1,600 participants, concluded that yoga provides small-to-moderate improvements in cancer-related fatigue and quality of life compared to interventions not involving physical activity. Therefore, it could be a supportive intervention for women with breast cancer, as an addition to standard treatment. A 2021 review of 26 studies of yoga-based interventions for depressive symptoms (1,486 participants) and 16 studies of yoga-based interventions for anxiety symptoms (977 participants) in people with various types of cancer found evidence that the interventions were helpful for both types of symptoms. The majority of the studies involved women with breast cancer. Yoga is generally considered a safe form of physical activity for healthy people when performed properly under the guidance of a qualified instructor. However, as with other forms of physical activity, injuries can occur. The most common injuries are sprains and strains. Serious injuries are rare. In studies of yoga in people with cancer, adverse events have mostly been minor. However, having an ongoing health problem such as cancer may increase the risks of doing yoga. If you have cancer, talk with your health care providers to find out whether any aspects of yoga might be unsafe for you. More information on yoga Nutritional Approaches Ginger Ginger is an herb that is sold as a dietary supplement. A 2019 evaluation of 18 studies with more than 1,600 participants concluded that the evidence on whether ginger is helpful for nausea associated with cancer chemotherapy is mixed. Some studies suggested that ginger helped to control nausea, but in other studies, ginger didn’t seem to have any effect. People diagnosed with cancer should consult their health care providers before taking ginger or any other dietary supplement. More information on ginger Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Treatment No complementary approach has been shown to cure cancer or cause it to go into remission. Some products or practices that have been advocated for cancer treatment may interfere with conventional cancer treatments or have other risks. If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer, you should consult your health care providers before using any complementary health approach. The following sections discuss a few products that have been promoted as cancer treatments. You can find information on additional products at the NCI website . Herbal Supplements Studies on whether herbal supplements or substances derived from them might be of value in cancer treatment are in their early stages, and scientific evidence is limited. Herbal supplements may have side effects, and some may interact in harmful ways with drugs, including those used in cancer treatment. Vitamin, Mineral, and Antioxidant Dietary Supplements The effects of taking vitamin and mineral dietary supplements, including antioxidant supplements, during cancer treatment are uncertain. Because these supplements might interfere with the effectiveness of chemotherapy or other cancer therapies, if you are being treated for cancer, you should discuss their use with your health care providers. Black Salves Products called black salves have been marketed for self-treatment of a variety of skin conditions, including skin cancer. Black salves are neither safe nor effective. When used to treat a skin cancer, black salve products may not remove all of it, which may allow the cancer to spread and become more serious. Also, black salves can destroy both cancerous and healthy skin. They can cause scarring and tissue damage, which is sometimes severe and disfiguring. Most black salve research involves case studies; well-controlled clinical trials have not been conducted. Laetrile Laetrile is another name for the natural substance amygdalin, a chemical constituent found in the pits of many fruits. A 2019 review of research on laetrile found no clinical evidence it is effective as a cancer treatment. Laetrile can have toxic effects. Intravenous Vitamin C Studies on the benefit of high-dose, intravenous vitamin C use for cancer have yielded varying results. Research in people is limited; most of the evidence is based on animal and laboratory research. The evidence is mixed for intravenous vitamin C’s impact on tumor growth or overall survival. Some studies have found an increase in quality of life and a decrease in cancer treatment–related toxicities, but the findings are not conclusive. Treatment with intravenous vitamin C generally seems to be well-tolerated and safe, but patients with certain conditions (e.g., iron overload, kidney disease) are at increased risk for serious toxicity. Curcumin Curcumin, a substance found in turmeric, has been studied for its possible effects on cancer development and progression. Because a variety of different products and dosages were tested, and because the studies were brief and included only small numbers of people, there isn’t enough evidence to recommend products that contain curcumin for the treatment of people with cancer. Researchers are studying curcumin’s usefulness for alleviating side effects caused by cancer treatment, such as oral mucositis and radiation-induced dermatitis (a skin rash caused by radiation treatment), as well as quality of life. Beware of Cancer Treatment Frauds The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned the public to beware of fraudulent cancer treatments promoted on websites or social media platforms. Some fraudulent cancer treatments are harmful by themselves, and others can be indirectly harmful because people may delay seeking medical care while they try them, or because the fraudulent product interferes with the effectiveness of proven cancer treatments. The people who sell fraudulent cancer treatments often market them with claims such as “treats all forms of cancer,” “cures cancer,” “selectively kills cancer cells,” or “more effective than chemotherapy.” If you’re considering using any anticancer product that you’ve seen in an advertisement, talk with your health care provider first. Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Prevention You can reduce your risk of cancer in several ways—including making healthy choices (such as avoiding tobacco and maintaining a healthy weight), getting recommended vaccines against hepatitis B and human papillomavirus (HPV), and getting appropriate cancer screening tests. Research has also been done to see whether various nutritional approaches might help to prevent cancer. Vitamin and Mineral Supplements The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force—an expert group that makes recommendations about the types of health care people should receive to prevent diseases—evaluated the evidence on vitamin and mineral supplements and cancer prevention in 2014. (A 2021 update to the report is underway and is anticipated to give the same advice.) The recommendations state that: You shouldn’t take vitamin E supplements to try to prevent cancer. Studies have shown that they don’t work. You shouldn’t take beta-carotene supplements to try to prevent cancer. Studies have shown that they don’t work, and they can harm some people, such as those who smoke tobacco. For all other vitamin and mineral supplements—including single vitamins or minerals, combinations such as calcium plus vitamin D, and multivitamins —there isn’t enough evidence to say whether they can help prevent cancer. The Task Force didn’t make a recommendation for or against the use of these supplements. Green Tea Studies of green tea and cancer in people have had inconsistent results. Based on current evidence, it isn’t possible to say whether green tea helps to prevent cancer. Green tea is believed to be safe when consumed as a beverage in moderate amounts. Liver problems have been reported in a small number of people who took concentrated green tea extracts. Experts suggest that green tea extracts should be taken with food, people with liver problems should not take green tea extracts, and users should discontinue use and consult a health care provider if they develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice (yellowing of the skin or eyes). Other Nutritional Approaches Several other dietary supplements, including garlic, Ginkgo biloba, noni, and grape seed extract, have been investigated for possible cancer-preventive effects, but the evidence on these substances is too limited for any conclusions to be reached. In two large observational studies in which researchers kept track of people over a period of years, people who took glucosamine and chondroitin were less likely to develop colorectal cancer. Because these were observational studies, rather than trials in which people were randomly assigned to take a supplement or a placebo, the results can only provide clues for further research; they can’t prove a cause-and-effect relationship because other factors could be involved. National Institutes of Health Research on Complementary Health Approaches for Cancer Some ongoing studies related to complementary approaches and cancer funded by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) or NCI are looking at: Whether panaxynol, a substance from American ginseng, can suppress colitis and thereby lower the risk of colon cancer The potential value of a multimodal mind and body intervention for reducing fear of cancer recurrence Self-administered hypnosis to manage hot flashes (which may be caused by breast cancer treatment) The potential value of yoga as a treatment for peripheral neuropathy, a painful side effect of some types of cancer chemotherapy More To Consider Gather information about the complementary health product or practice that interests you, and then discuss it with your health care providers. If you’ve been diagnosed with cancer, it’s especially important to talk with your health care providers before you start using any new complementary health approach. If you’re already using a complementary approach, tell your health care providers about it, even if your reason for using it has nothing to do with cancer. Here are examples of questions to ask: What is known about the benefits and risks of this product or practice? Do the benefits outweigh the risks? What are the potential side effects? Will this approach interfere with my cancer treatment? Can you refer me to a practitioner? Don’t use any health product or practice that has not been proven safe and effective to replace conventional cancer care or as a reason to postpone seeing your health care provider about any health problem. Take charge of your health—talk with your health care providers about any complementary health approaches you use. Together, you can make shared, well-informed decisions.

Physical activity is defined as any movement that uses skeletal muscles and requires more energy than resting. Physical activity can include walking, running, dancing, biking, swimming, performing household chores, exercising, and engaging in sports activities. A measure called the metabolic equivalent of task, or MET, is used to characterize the intensity of physical activity. One MET is the rate of energy expended by a person sitting at rest. Light-intensity activities expend less than 3 METs, moderate-intensity activities expend 3 to 6 METs, and vigorous activities expend 6 or more METs ( 1 ). Sedentary behavior is any waking behavior characterized by an energy expenditure of 1.5 or fewer METs while sitting, reclining, or lying down ( 1 ). Examples of sedentary behaviors include most office work, driving a vehicle, and sitting while watching television. A person can be physically active and yet spend a substantial amount of time being sedentary. What is known about the relationship between physical activity and cancer risk? Evidence linking higher physical activity to lower cancer risk comes mainly from observational studies , in which individuals report on their physical activity and are followed for years for diagnoses of cancer. Although observational studies cannot prove a causal relationship, when studies in different populations have similar results and when a possible mechanism for a causal relationship exists, this provides evidence of a causal connection. There is strong evidence that higher levels of physical activity are linked to lower risk of several types of cancer ( 2 – 4 ). Bladder cancer: In a 2014 meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies and 4 case-control studies , the risk of bladder cancer was 15% lower for individuals with the highest level of recreational or occupational physical activity than in those with the lowest level ( 5 ). A pooled analysis of over 1 million individuals found that leisure-time physical activity was linked to a 13% reduced risk of bladder cancer ( 6 ). Breast cancer: Many studies have shown that physically active women have a lower risk of breast cancer than inactive women. In a 2016 meta-analysis that included 38 cohort studies, the most physically active women had a 12–21% lower risk of breast cancer than those who were least physically active ( 7 ). Physical activity has been associated with similar reductions in risk of breast cancer among both premenopausal and postmenopausal women ( 7 , 8 ). Women who increase their physical activity after menopause may also have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who do not ( 9 , 10 ). Colon cancer: In a 2016 meta-analysis of 126 studies, individuals who engaged in the highest level of physical activity had a 19% lower risk of colon cancer than those who were the least physically active ( 11 ). Endometrial cancer: Several meta-analyses and cohort studies have examined the relationship between physical activity and the risk of endometrial cancer (cancer of the lining of the uterus ) ( 12 – 15 ). In a meta-analysis of 33 studies, highly physically active women had a 20% lower risk of endometrial cancer than women with low levels of physical activity ( 12 ). There is some evidence that the association is indirect, in that physical activity would have to reduce obesity for the benefits to be observed. Obesity is a strong risk factor for endometrial cancer ( 12 – 14 ). Esophageal cancer: A 2014 meta-analysis of nine cohort and 15 case–control studies found that the individuals who were most physically active had a 21% lower risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma than those who were least physically active ( 16 ). Kidney (renal cell) cancer: In a 2013 meta-analysis of 11 cohort studies and 8 case–control studies, individuals who were the most physically active had a 12% lower risk of renal cancer than those who were the least active ( 17 ). A pooled analysis of over 1 million individuals found that leisure-time physical activity was linked to a 23% reduced risk of kidney cancer ( 6 ). Stomach (gastric) cancer: A 2016 meta-analysis of 10 cohort studies and 12 case–control studies reported that individuals who were the most physically active had a 19% lower risk of stomach cancer than those who were least active ( 18 ). There is some evidence that physical activity is associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer ( 2 , 4 ). However, it is possible that differences in smoking, rather than in physical activity, are what explain the association of physical activity with reduced risk of lung cancer. In a 2016 meta-analysis of 25 observational studies, physical activity was associated with reduced risk of lung cancer among former and current smokers but was not associated with risk of lung cancer among never smokers ( 19 ). For several other cancers, there is more limited evidence of an association. These include certain cancers of the blood, as well as cancers of the pancreas, prostate, ovaries, thyroid, liver, and rectum ( 2 , 6 ). How might physical activity be linked to reduced risks of cancer? Exercise has many biological effects on the body, some of which have been proposed to explain associations with specific cancers. These include: Lowering the levels of sex hormones , such as estrogen , and growth factors that have been associated with cancer development and progression ( 20 ) [breast, colon] Preventing high blood levels of insulin , which has been linked to cancer development and progression ( 20 ) [breast, colon] Reducing inflammation Improving immune system function Altering the metabolism of bile acids, decreasing exposure of the gastrointestinal tract to these suspected carcinogens ( 21 , 22 ) [colon] Reducing the time it takes for food to travel through the digestive system , which decreases gastrointestinal tract exposure to possible carcinogens [colon] Helping to prevent obesity , which is a risk factor for many cancers What is known about the relationship between being sedentary and the risk of cancer? Although there are fewer studies of sedentary behavior and cancer risk than of physical activity and cancer risk, sedentary behavior—sitting, reclining, or lying down for extended periods of time (other than sleeping)—is a risk factor for developing many chronic conditions and premature death ( 4 , 23 , 24 ). It may also be associated with increased risk for certain cancers ( 23 , 25 ). How much physical activity is recommended? The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, 2nd edition, released in 2018 ( 1 ), recommends that, for substantial health benefits and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, including cancer, adults engage in 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity, 75 to 100 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or an equivalent combination of each intensity each week. This physical activity can be done in episodes of any length. muscle-strengthening activities at least 2 days a week balance training, in addition to aerobic and muscle-strengthening activity Is physical activity beneficial for cancer survivors? Yes. A report of the 2018 American College of Sports Medicine International Multidisciplinary Roundtable on Physical Activity and Cancer Prevention and Control ( 26 ) concluded that exercise training and testing are generally safe for cancer survivors and that every survivor should maintain some level of physical activity. The Roundtable also found strong evidence that moderate-intensity aerobic training and/or resistance exercise during and after cancer treatment can reduce anxiety, depressive symptoms, and fatigue and improve health-related quality of life and physical function strong evidence that exercise training is safe in persons who have or might develop breast-cancer - related lymphedema some evidence that exercise is beneficial for bone health and sleep quality insufficient evidence that physical activity can help prevent cardiotoxicity or chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy or improve cognitive function, falls, nausea, pain, sexual function, or treatment tolerance In addition, research findings have raised the possibility that physical activity may have beneficial effects on survival for patients with breast, colorectal, and prostate cancers ( 26 , 27 ). Breast cancer: In a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies , breast cancer survivors who were the most physically active had a 42% lower risk of death from any cause and a 40% lower risk of death from breast cancer than those who were the least physically active ( 28 ). Colorectal cancer: Evidence from multiple epidemiologic studies suggests that physical activity after a colorectal cancer diagnosis is associated with a 30% lower risk of death from colorectal cancer and a 38% lower risk of death from any cause ( 4 ). Prostate cancer: Limited evidence from a few epidemiologic studies suggests that physical activity after a prostate cancer diagnosis is associated with a 33% lower risk of death from prostate cancer and a 45% lower risk of death from any cause ( 4 ). There is very limited evidence for beneficial effects of physical activity on survival for other cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, stomach cancer, and malignant glioma ( 4 ). What additional research is under way on the relationship between physical activity and cancer? Findings from observational studies provide much evidence for a link between higher levels of physical activity and lower risk of cancer. However, these studies cannot fully rule out the possibility that active people have lower cancer risk because they engage in other healthy lifestyle behaviors. For this reason, clinical trials that randomly assign participants to exercise interventions provide the strongest evidence because they eliminate bias caused by pre-existing illness and attendant physical inactivity. To confirm the observational evidence and define the potential magnitude of the effect, several large clinical trials are examining physical activity and/or exercise interventions in cancer patients and survivors. These include the Breast Cancer Weight Loss (BWEL) trial in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients, the CHALLENGE trial in colon cancer patients who have recently completed chemotherapy ( 29 ), and the INTERVAL-GAP4 trial in men with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer ( 30 ). Many additional questions have yet to be answered in several broad areas of research on physical activity and cancer: What are the mechanisms by which physical activity reduces cancer risk? What is the optimal time in life, intensity, duration, and/or frequency of physical activity needed to reduce the risk of cancer, both overall and for specific sites? Is sedentary behavior associated with increased risk of cancer? Does the association between physical activity and cancer differ by age or race/ethnicity? Does physical activity reduce the risk of cancer in people who have inherited a genetic variant that increases cancer risk? Print Email",

    "content": "National Center for Integrative Primary Healthcare NCIPH Get Involved Learn about the Online Curriculum What is acupuncture? Acupuncture is a type of traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used for thousands of years. An acupuncturist puts very thin needles in certain points in your body to treat different conditions. How does acupuncture work? Traditional Chinese medicine says that acupuncture balances “qi” or “chi.” Qi or chi is the energy flow in your body. This energy is sometimes blocked in parts of your body. Western medicine says that acupuncture stimulates nerves, muscles, and connective tissue. What is acupuncture good for? Acupuncture has been used to treat many conditions. It has been shown to help with the following conditions: Condition Benefits Pain Helps with pain, including lower back, neck, and knee pain. Headache Helps with pain from migraines and tension headaches. Also helps them happen less often. Osteoarthritis Helps with pain from osteoarthritis. Other conditions Acupuncture can also sometimes help with substance use, anxiety, asthma, depression fibromyalgia menstrual issues, nausea or vomiting after surgery, pain with labor, sinusitis, and urinary problems. Speak with your health professional. In some cases, acupuncture can work better when combined with other types of care. Are there different types of acupuncture? Yes. The main type of acupuncture done in the United States is Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) based acupuncture. There are other types of acupuncture as well. Acupuncture can be done one on one or in a group setting. Are there any side effects or risks? Acupuncture is generally safe. Minor bruising and bleeding can sometimes happen where the needle is put in. Sometimes the needles can hurt a little bit when they are put in, but most times it does not hurt at all. Who should be cautious about using acupuncture? People with bleeding disorders: You must be careful if you have a bleeding disorder or are taking blood thinners. Having a pacemaker: Some types of acupuncture use electrical pulses. This can be a problem if you have a pacemaker. Being pregnant: Some types of acupuncture might stimulate labor. Please inform your health professional if you have any of the above conditions. How do I find an acupuncturist? Different types of health professionals can be trained to do acupuncture. Some are medical doctors (MDs), some are licensed acupuncturists, and some are naturopathic physicians or Oriental Medical doctors (OMDs). Talk to your primary health care provider to find someone in your area. Group or community acupuncture is sometimes the least expensive! What should I expect from my first visit? Your acupuncturist will ask about your symptoms, behaviors, and lifestyle. He or she may closely examine: Any body parts that are painful Your tongue The color of your face Your pulse Your acupuncturist will come up with your treatment plan. It may include several visits. The first visit may take up to one hour. Your visits after the first one will be shorter.

    "content": "What Is Mindfulness? - Mindful Adobe Stock/stournsaeh What Is Mindfulness ? The practice of being fully present and aware of your current experience—without overreacting or getting lost in thoughts. Core Concept: It’s an innate human ability that you can access and cultivate through practices like seated, walking, standing, or moving meditation. Benefits: Mindfulness enhances focus and performance, reduces stress, deepens self-insight, and fosters compassion toward oneself and others. Everyday Integration: Mindfulness can be applied through brief pauses and by merging it with activities such as yoga or sports. Mind-Body Connection: Mindfulness meditation begins in the body; awareness of your physical posture and sensations is essential. Sit on a stable surface (chair, cushion, bench) ensuring your feet are grounded or legs comfortably crossed. Keep your spine naturally curved, shoulders relaxed, and chin slightly dropped. Let your gaze be soft. Focus on your breath and gently return your attention when distractions arise. Mindfulness. It’s a pretty straightforward word. It suggests that the mind is fully attending to what’s happening, to what you’re doing, to the space you’re moving through. That might seem trivial, except for the annoying fact that we so often veer from the matter at hand. Our mind takes flight, we lose touch with our body, and pretty soon we’re engrossed in obsessive thoughts about something that just happened or fretting about the future. And that makes us anxious. Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive. Yet no matter how far we drift away, mindfulness is right there to snap us back to where we are and what we’re doing and feeling. If you want to know what mindfulness is, it’s best to try it for a while. Since it’s hard to nail down in words, you will find slight variations in the meaning in books, websites, audio, and video. Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us. Mindfulness is a quality that every human being already possesses, it’s not something you have to conjure up, you just have to learn how to access it. While mindfulness is innate, it can be cultivated through proven techniques . Here are some examples: Seated , walking , standing, and moving meditation (it’s also possible lying down but often leads to sleep); Short pauses we insert into everyday life; Merging meditation practice with other activities, such as yoga or sports . When we meditate it doesn’t help to fixate on the benefits, but rather to just do the practice, and yet there are benefits or no one would do it. When we’re mindful, we reduce stress , enhance performance , gain insight and awareness through observing our own mind, and increase our attention to others’ well-being. Mindfulness meditation gives us a time in our lives when we can suspend judgment and unleash our natural curiosity about the workings of the mind, approaching our experience with warmth and kindness —to ourselves and others. Mindfulness is not obscure or exotic. It’s familiar to us because it’s what we already do, how we already are. It takes many shapes and goes by many names. Mindfulness is not a special added thing we do. We already have the capacity to be present, and it doesn’t require us to change who we are. But we can cultivate these innate qualities with simple practices that are scientifically demonstrated to benefit ourselves, our loved ones, our friends and neighbors, the people we work with, and the institutions and organizations we take part in You don’t need to change. Solutions that ask us to change who we are or become something we’re not have failed us over and over again. Mindfulness recognizes and cultivates the best of who we are as human beings. Mindfulness has the potential to become a transformative social phenomenon. Here’s why: Anyone can do it. Mindfulness practice cultivates universal human qualities and does not require anyone to change their beliefs. Everyone can benefit and it’s easy to learn. It’s a way of living. Mindfulness is more than just a practice. It brings awareness and caring into everything we do—and it cuts down needless stress. Even a little mindfulness makes our lives better. It’s evidence based. We don’t have to take mindfulness on faith. Both science and experience demonstrate its positive benefits for our health, happiness, work, and relationships. It sparks innovation. As we deal with our world’s increasing complexity and uncertainty, mindfulness can lead us to effective, resilient, low-cost responses to seemingly intransigent problems. When we think about mindfulness and meditating (with a capital M), we can get hung up on thinking about our thoughts: we’re going to do something about what’s happening in our heads. It’s as if these bodies we have are just inconvenient sacks for our brains to lug around. Having it all remain in your head, though, lacks a feeling of good old gravity. Meditation begins and ends in the body. It involves taking the time to pay attention to where we are and what’s going on. That approach can make it seem like floating—as though we don’t have to walk. We can just waft. But meditation begins and ends in the body. It involves taking the time to pay attention to where we are and what’s going on, and that starts with being aware of our body. That very act can be calming, since our body has internal rhythms that help it relax if we give it a chance. Here’s a posture practice that can be used as the beginning stage of a period of meditation practice or simply as something to do for a minute, maybe to stabilize yourself and find a moment of relaxation before going back into the fray. If you have injuries or other physical difficulties, you can modify this to suit your situation. Take your seat. Whatever you’re sitting on—a chair, a meditation cushion, a park bench—find a spot that gives you a stable, solid seat, not perching or hanging back. Notice what your legs are doing. If on a cushion on the floor, cross your legs comfortably in front of you. (If you already do some kind of seated yoga posture, go ahead.) If on a chair, it’s good if the bottoms of your feet are touching the floor. Straighten—but don’t stiffen— your upper body. The spine has natural curvature. Let it be there. Your head and shoulders can comfortably rest on top of your vertebrae. Situate your upper arms parallel to your upper body. Then let your hands drop onto the tops of your legs. With your upper arms at your sides, your hands will land in the right spot. Too far forward will make you hunch. Too far back will make you stiff. You’re tuning the strings of your body—not too tight and not too loose. Drop your chin a little and let your gaze fall gently downward. You may let your eyelids lower. If you feel the need, you may lower them completely, but it’s not necessary to close your eyes when meditating. You can simply let what appears before your eyes be there without focusing on it. Be there for a few moments. Relax. Pay attention to your breath or the sensations in your body. Begin again. When your posture is established, feel your breath—or some say “follow” it—as it goes out and as it goes in. (Some versions of the practice put more emphasis on the outbreath, and for the inbreath you simply leave a spacious pause.) Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing this—in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes—return your attention to the breath. Don’t bother judging yourself or obsessing over the content of the thoughts. Come back. You go away, you come back. That’s it. That’s the practice. It’s often been said that it’s very simple, but it’s not necessarily easy. The work is to just keep doing it. Results will accrue. A 5-Minute Breathing Meditation To Cultivate Mindfulness . This practice is designed to reduce stress, anxiety, and negative emotions, cool yourself down when your temper flares, and sharpen your concentration skills.

    "content": "Mindfulness | Psychology Today Skip to main content Mindfulness is a state of active, open attention to the present. This state is described as observing one’s thoughts and feelings without judging them as good or bad. Contents Understanding Mindfulness Practicing Mindfulness The Benefits of Mindfulness Understanding Mindfulness To live mindfully is to live in the moment and reawaken oneself to the present, rather than dwelling on the past or anticipating the future. To be mindful is to observe and label thoughts, feelings, sensations in the body in an objective manner. Mindfulness can therefore be a tool to avoid self-criticism and judgment while identifying and managing difficult emotions. Mindfulness is rooted in Buddhist and Hindu teachings. Buddhism includes a journey toward enlightenment, and the concept of “sati,”—which encompasses attention, awareness, and being present—is considered the first step toward enlightenment. The term was roughly translated from the ancient language Pali into the term “mindfulness.” The emergence of mindfulness in Western culture can be attributed to Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn studied mindfulness under several Buddhist teachers, such as Philip Kapleau and Thich Nhat Hanh. As a professor at the University of Massachusetts medical school in the late 1970s, Kabat-Zinn developed a program called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to treat chronic pain . He discovered that patients would often try to avoid pain—but that that avoidance would lead to deeper distress. Practicing mindfulness was a more successful approach. As mindfulness shifted into mainstream science and medicine, it became a pivotal therapeutic technique; it was integrated into Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy , Dialectical Behavior Therapy, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, among others. What is mindfulness? Created with Sketch. Mindfulness encompasses two key ingredients: awareness and acceptance. Awareness is the knowledge and ability to focus attention on one’s inner processes and experiences, such as the experience of the present moment. Acceptance is the ability to observe and accept—rather than judge or avoid—those streams of thought. What is the purpose of mindfulness? Created with Sketch. The goal of mindfulness is to cultivate perspective on one’s consciousness and identity that can bring greater peace mentally and relationally. Mindfulness may also be used in mindfulness-based therapies, to address stress, anxiety , or pain, and simply to become more relaxed. What is the history of mindfulness? Created with Sketch. Mindfulness has its origins in Buddhist and Hindu teachings, from which the concept “sati” was roughly translated to “mindfulness.” The practice was popularized in the West through the work of Jon-Kabat Zinn. Zinn created Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction to treat pain, anxiety, and stress, and he ultimately brought mindfulness into mainstream clinical practice. What’s the difference between mindfulness and flow? Created with Sketch. Flow is a state in which one is completely absorbed in an activity and loses self-awareness. Flow and mindfulness both involve deep concentration —but only flow involves goal-directed behavior. While mindfulness channels concentration entirely toward the present moment, flow channels concentration toward skills and goal achievement, which might include thoughts of the past and future and judgment of those thoughts. What’s the difference between mindfulness and meditation ? Created with Sketch. Mindfulness is one form of meditation. Meditation utilizes various practices to quiet the mind or achieve a higher level of consciousness, one of which is mindfulness. Mindfulness can be cultivated within or outside of formal meditation and woven into any activity, such as taking a walk or being engaged in conversation. Practicing Mindfulness A person’s experience of time tends to be subjective and heavily influenced by their emotional state. Fears and insecurities about the past and the future can make it difficult to fully appreciate the present. The key is learning how to pay attention. Mindfulness can take place through meditation sessions or smaller moments throughout the day. To cultivate a state of mindfulness, you can begin by sitting down and taking deep breaths. Focus on each breath and the sensations of the moment, such as sounds, scents, the temperature, and the feeling of air passing in and out of the body. Shift your attention, then, to the thoughts and emotions that you’re experiencing. Allow each thought to exist without judging it or ascribing negativity to it. Sit with those thoughts. The experience may evoke a strong emotional reaction. Exploring that response can be an opportunity to address or resolve underlying challenges. How do I practice mindfulness? Created with Sketch. To cultivate awareness, observe your thoughts and emotions and explore why those specific ideas might be surfacing. To cultivate acceptance, avoid judging or pushing away unpleasant thoughts. Emotions are natural and everyone has them—acknowledging them can help you understand yourself better and move forward. How can I be more mindful? Created with Sketch. Mindfulness can help bring you into the present moment throughout the day. As you wake up, you can focus on your breathing and the way your body gradually becomes more energized. You can incorporate a brief meditation into your work day, perhaps on your lunch break, and focus and appreciate the experience of eating during meals. Why is mindfulness so popular? Created with Sketch. Mindfulness has been embraced by corporate leaders, sports teams, the military, and countless individuals around the world. The practice may owe its popularity to today’s fast-paced, technology-driven world, rife with financial and time pressures. Mindfulness may represent an unmet need for moments of quiet, contemplation, and calm . The Benefits of Mindfulness Mindfulness is frequently used in meditation and certain kinds of therapy. Its benefits include lowering stress levels, reducing harmful ruminating, and protecting against depression and anxiety. Research even suggests that mindfulness can help people better cope with rejection and social isolation . Does mindfulness really work? Created with Sketch. Review studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can help reduce anxiety, depression, and pain. To a lesser extent, they can alleviate stress and improve quality of life. However, inconsistencies in the way mindfulness is defined and measured make it difficult to determine whether mindfulness really provides other benefits. How does mindfulness help relieve anxiety? Created with Sketch. Mindfulness encompasses awareness and acceptance, which can help people understand and cope with uncomfortable emotions, allowing them to gain control and relief. To cultivate these skills, concentrate on breathing to lengthen and deepen your breaths. Foster an awareness of the five senses. Notice your thoughts and feelings, and practice curiosity and self-compassion. Can mindfulness help me break bad habits? Created with Sketch. Mindfulness can play a role in helping people break habits such as smoking or overeating. When a habit has developed, the trigger (hunger) prompts a behavior (eating) that leads to a reward (satisfaction). Becoming aware of the behavior and what is derived from it can help alter the reward and replace it with a healthier behavior . Can mindfulness help my relationship? Created with Sketch. Higher levels of mindfulness predict happier and more satisfying relationships, research suggests. It’s difficult to disentangle whether mindfulness directly caused those improvements, but mindfulness does benefit key relationship skills, such as being present and attentive, regulating emotions, being self-aware, and cultivating empathy and compassion.

Spiritual Practice Feature by Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat Facebook Link Print Share We go through three entrances and use three sets of keys to get into our home. First, we open the entrance to our building from the street and walk into a lobby. Before the elevator will go up, we have to unlock the call button for our floor. Upstairs, we pass through a hallway and use another key to open our apartment door. When we go out, we transit the same doors but use fewer keys — the elevator and the street door lock behind us. We move from place to place by going through a series of betweens: between the outside and the inside, between the lobby and the apartment, between a room and the exit. Rarely can we go anywhere without going through a transition space — or time. In the Christian monastic tradition, the practice of statio acknowledges the importance of times between times. In her book about Benedictine spirituality, Wisdom Distilled from the Daily , Joan Chittister explains that members of the community stop outside the chapel for a few minutes before entering for prayer. \"The practice of statio is meant to center us and make us conscious of what we're about to do and make us present to God who is present to us. Statio is the desire to do consciously what I might otherwise do mechanically. Statio is the virtue of presence.\" Using this Christian practice, we can reframe the many transition times and places we experience during the day. Instead of regarding them as wasted periods, unavoidable delays, or inconveniences, we can see them as divine invitations to stop, to recenter ourselves, and to become more aware of God's presence in the world around us. We can use transitions as opportunities to contemplate the things that matter to us, to give thanks for all the gifts from the Creator, and to prepare to connect with our loved ones. This kind of refreshing pause or mini-Sabbath does not have to be complicated or long. Just consciously choose to stop, close your eyes, and relax your body. Take a deep breath and as you exhale, let go of any anxieties. Shrug your shoulders or shake out your hands. Rest in the moment and know that this special moment which will never come again. Savor it and give thanks to God. You can weave a sacred pause or statio into your daily life. Here are some suggestions. Pause outside your door as you leave for work or school. Say quietly to yourself: \"This is a day the Lord has made. I will watch for God's presence in my life today. I will stay open to the grace of God.\" Just before you leave your car, train, or bus, say a silent prayer for all those you have passed on your journey, that they may know health, happiness, peace, and well-being. This statio practice may be repeated as you leave a restaurant at lunch or a store after shopping. On the elevator to your office, focus on the beginning of your workday. Say a prayer asking that your work be blessed and of service to your employer and the world at large. Think about the people you will meet during the day and give thanks for their support and creativity. If you are in conflict with a co-worker, ask that you may be forgiving and forgiven. Before entering a doctor or dentist's office for an appointment, or the gym for your workout, thank your body for being such a faithful trooper. Know and accept that God cherishes every hair on your head. Returning home, pause before entering your house or apartment. Be conscious of the moment's importance, that you are moving from your involvement with the outside world into the space of your home. Leave any stresses and problems of the day, any unfinished business, on your doorstep. (You can always pick them up again the next morning.) If you share your home with others, remember what you are bringing to them — the fruits of your labor, perhaps, but most important, your loving presence. Use this refreshing pause to prepare for a blessed reunion with them.

We affirm that there are good things in the world, gifts and benefits we’ve received.” In the second part of gratitude, he explains, “we recognize that the sources of this goodness are outside of ourselves. … We acknowledge that other people—or even higher powers, if you’re of a spiritual mindset—gave us many gifts, big and small, to help us achieve the goodness in our lives.” Emmons and other researchers see the social dimension as being especially important to gratitude. “I see it as a relationship-strengthening emotion,“ writes Emmons, “because it requires us to see how we’ve been supported and affirmed by other people.” Because gratitude encourages us not only to appreciate gifts but to repay them (or pay them forward), the sociologist Georg Simmel called it “the moral memory of mankind.” This is how gratitude may have evolved : by strengthening bonds between members of the same species who mutually helped each other out. To investigate how gratitude relates to bonding and empathy, pioneering research is exploring what gratitude looks like in the brain .

Feeling Appreciated at Home Affects Our Work Life By Leila Rosenberg | November 26, 2024 A new study finds that leaders who reflect on gratitude they receive at home are more supportive and helpful to their employees. Over the past 15 years, hundreds of studies have documented the social , physical , and psychological benefits of gratitude . The research suggests these benefits are available to most anyone who practices gratitude, even in the midst of adversity , such as elderly people confronting death , women with breast cancer , and people coping with a chronic muscular disease. Here are some of the top research-based reasons for practicing gratitude. Gratitude brings us happiness : Through research by Robert Emmons, happiness expert Sonja Lyubomirsky, and many other scientists, practicing gratitude has proven to be one of the most reliable methods for increasing happiness and life satisfaction; it also boosts feelings of optimism , joy, pleasure, enthusiasm, and other positive emotions. On the flip side, gratitude also reduces anxiety and depression and could be a helpful part of therapy . Research suggests it may help reduce depression among people with chronic disease. Gratitude is good for our bodies : Studies by Emmons and his colleague Michael McCullough suggest gratitude strengthens the immune system, lowers blood pressure, reduces symptoms of illness, and makes us less bothered by aches and pains. It also encourages us to exercise more and take better care of our health. Grateful people sleep better : They get more hours of sleep each night, spend less time awake before falling asleep, and feel more refreshed upon awakening. If you want to sleep more soundly, count blessings, not sheep. Gratitude makes us more resilient : It has been found to help people recover from traumatic events, including Vietnam War veterans with PTSD, victims of natural disasters, and people living under violent, political conflict . Gratitude strengthens relationships : It makes us feel closer and more committed to friends and romantic partners . When partners feel and express gratitude for each other , they each become more satisfied with their relationship . Gratitude may also encourage a more equitable division of labor between partners. Gratitude promotes forgiveness —even between ex-spouses after a divorce. Gratitude makes us “ pay it forward ”: Grateful people are more helpful , altruistic , and compassionate—in other words, more prosocial . Gratitude is good for kids : Children as young as six or seven are more generous when they’re feeling grateful, and grateful adolescents tend to be more resilient . When 10-19 year olds practice gratitude, they report greater life satisfaction and more positive emotion, and they feel more connected to their community . Gratitude is good for schools : Studies suggest it makes students feel better about their school; it also makes teachers feel more satisfied and accomplished, and less emotionally exhausted, possibly reducing teacher burnout. For more: Read Emmons’ essay about “ Why Gratitude is Good ” and Giacomo Bono’s essay on “ What We Still Don’t Know about Gratitude and Youth .” Six Steps to Decluttering Your Life By Beth Kurland | April 15, 2025 Organizing and getting rid of some of your belongings can be a satisfying way to feel better and practice gratitude and mindfulness. Why Forcing Gratitude in Kids Backfires—And What to Do Instead By Lainie Rowell | April 7, 2025 By understanding how gratitude naturally develops in children, we can encourage rather than enforce thankfulness. 14 Movies That Highlight the Best in Humanity: 2025 By Sahar Habib Ghazi , Maryam Abdullah , Zaid Jilani , Joanne Chen , Jason Marsh , Katherine Reynolds Lewis , Margaret Golden , Criss Cuervo , Aurelia Santos , Jill Suttie , Jeremy Adam Smith , Kia Afcari | February 26, 2025 It’s time again for the Greater Goodies, honoring movies from the past year that exemplify human strengths and virtues.

Are you a natural pessimist? Take heart: The benefits of gratitude aren’t only available to people with a naturally grateful disposition. Instead, feeling grateful is a skill we can develop with practice, reaping its rewards along the way. Here are some specific, science-based activities for cultivating an attitude of gratitude from our new site Greater Good in Action : Three Good Things: A way to tune into the positive events in your life. Gratitude Letter: Write a letter expressing thanks, and deliver it in person. Mental Subtraction of Positive Events : How to appreciate what you have by imagining your life without it. One variation on this practice is Mental Subtraction of Relationships. Savoring Walk: How a stroll outside can help build lasting happiness. Give It Up : Savor something more by taking a break from it. And here are more of the most effective ways to cultivate gratitude, according to research. Keep a gratitude journal , recording three to five things for which you’re grateful every day or week. Because some evidence suggests that how we keep a gratitude journal—for instance, how often we write in it or whether we express our gratitude to others —can influence its impact, the GGSC’s Jason Marsh offers these research-based tips for gratitude journaling. Apply these tips through the GGSC’s new and easy-to-use online gratitude journal, Thnx4.org . Write a “gratitude letter” to an important person in your life whom you’ve never properly thanked. Research suggests gratitude letters provide strong and long-lasting happiness boosts , especially when they’re delivered in person. When participants in her studies write gratitude letters, Sonja Lyubomirsky provides them with these instructions . Savor the good in your life—don’t just gloss over the beauty and pleasures that come your way. Loyola University psychologist Fred Bryant has identified 10 ways to practice savoring ; GGSC advisory board member Rick Hanson has developed his own method for savoring positive emotions and experiences, which he calls “ taking in the good .“ Focus on intentions: When you receive a gift, or when something good happens to you in general, consider how someone tried on purpose to bring that goodness into your life, even at a cost to themselves. Research suggests this goes a long way toward cultivating “an attitude of gratitude,“ among children and adults alike. Teach gratitude to children : Researchers Jeffrey Froh, Giacomo Bono , Katherine Henderson, and colleagues have developed a gratitude curriculum for kids, based on Froh’s work studying gratitude in schools ; results suggest it can boost gratitude and happiness for five months. The gratitude journal and gratitude letter exercises have also proven effective with kids, but there are many other gratitude lessons you can try. Create a grateful school climate by fostering gratitude among staff and working to counter the culture of complaining . Create a grateful workplace by getting buy-in from leaders, providing lots of opportunities for gratitude, and making sure that everyone gets thanked. Recognize the positive: The GGSC’s Christine Carter asks her daughters about three good things that happen to them each day—a way to help them appreciate the gifts big and small that come their way. Get metaphysical: Research suggests that thinking hard about our own mortality makes us more grateful for life; another study found that praying more often increases gratitude .

Establish a daily practice in which you remind yourself of the gifts, grace, benefits, and good things you enjoy. Setting aside time on a daily basis to recall moments of gratitude associated with ordinary events, your personal attributes, or valued people in your life gives you the potential to interweave a sustainable life theme of gratefulness. 2. Remember the Bad. To be grateful in your current state, it is helpful to remember the hard times that you once experienced. When you remember how difficult life used to be and how far you have come, you set up an explicit contrast in your mind, and this contrast is fertile ground for gratefulness. 3. Ask Yourself Three Questions. Utilize the meditation technique known as Naikan, which involves reflecting on three questions: “What have I received from __?”, “What have I given to __?”, and “What troubles and difficulty have I caused?” 4. Learn Prayers of Gratitude. In many spiritual traditions, prayers of gratitude are considered to be the most powerful form of prayer, because through these prayers people recognize the ultimate source of all they are and all they will ever be.

Through our senses—the ability to touch, see, smell, taste, and hear—we gain an appreciation of what it means to be human and of what an incredible miracle it is to be alive. Seen through the lens of gratitude, the human body is not only a miraculous construction, but also a gift. 6. Use Visual Reminders. Because the two primary obstacles to gratefulness are forgetfulness and a lack of mindful awareness, visual reminders can serve as cues to trigger thoughts of gratitude. Often times, the best visual reminders are other people. 7. Make a Vow to Practice Gratitude. Research shows that making an oath to perform a behavior increases the likelihood that the action will be executed. Therefore, write your own gratitude vow, which could be as simple as “I vow to count my blessings each day,” and post it somewhere where you will be reminded of it every day. 8. Watch your Language. Grateful people have a particular linguistic style that uses the language of gifts, givers, blessings, blessed, fortune, fortunate, and abundance. In gratitude, you should not focus on how inherently good you are, but rather on the inherently good things that others have done on your behalf. 9. Go Through the Motions. If you go through grateful motions, the emotion of gratitude should be triggered. Grateful motions include smiling, saying thank you, and writing letters of gratitude. 10. Think Outside the Box. If you want to make the most out of opportunities to flex your gratitude muscles, you must creatively look for new situations and circumstances in which to feel grateful.

I’ve started to use your ideas, themes and language within professional development sessions for leaders in schools and social services in our quiet corner of very rural England. We run these as facilitated small group dialogues, and we’ve found your work to be immensely engaging and the ensuing discussions to be rich and productive. Of particular interest has been the fact that gratitude and its consequences seem almost universally underplayed - until it becomes overtly recognised and discussed - after which nothing can be the same again. This is indeed liberating and transformational stuff - keep on with it, and please let’s have more explicit links with effective and ethical leadership.

    "content": "Hearty Gratitude Practices - Grateful.org Light a Candle Send an eCard Private Journal Brother David Article Jennifer J. Wilhoit, PhD Share I am giddy, smitten, overcome with palpable gratitude: I just viewed a photograph I took earlier this morning as the firesmoke-enshrouded sun rose up through the trees edging my yard. And something primal woke up in me as I fell into the unexpected beauty of that image. My inner landscape feels vast and spacious. The air within is clear, bright. And all possibilities exist; I am burgeoning with wellbeing. This is how great gratefulness can feel! But a feeling of gratitude is transient, and is not the deepest entry point into a life of gratefulness. Being grateful is how we live the depths of gratitude—and this necessitates a process. Becoming conscious of the power of gratitude and making a commitment to be a conduit for and of it entails action: a frequent and sustained practice of the types of activities that water the seed of gratitude so that it might flourish. In this article, I will offer a few short lists of what I have come to experience as some of the foundational practices of gratitude. I have loosely grouped them into categories: writing, nature, receiving/serving, and adversity. Coupled with these practices, I strive to deepen a set of sensitivities that I feel are “kin” to gratefulness: acceptance, compassion, kindness, generosity, gentleness, joy, peace, and presence. For me, these are also aspects of an impassioned, embodied experience of gratefulness. Anything we can do to cultivate these qualities will bolster our efforts at gratitude. Writing for Gratitude These require only a writing implement and paper. (I always advocate for handwritten over typewritten.) Write a simple gratitude list: daily or weekly. Make very specific and highly-detailed gratitude lists. Practice the ABCs of gratitude (name one gratitude per alphabet letter). Write out a story about a particular thing for which you’re grateful. Write a gratitude list of things you tend to take for granted (the most basic is being alive; but also, the ability to breathe, to walk, to read…). Journal about a striking aspect of nature. Write thank-you letters by hand, and send them via the postal service. Make blessings cards (which include a word or short phrase that affirms, empowers, comforts, inspires). Write 1-2 paragraphs about a moment of deep connection with someone; share this piece of writing. Nature and Gratitude All of these are intended to be done out of doors. Create a nature altar. This can be as simple as placing a stone on the ground, making a circle out of leaves, or placing shells in a spiral shape. Breathe in and look at the landscape with soft eyes. Pay attention to different scales of perspective. (Look small and close in; look vast and far.) Sit, walk, play, hike in nature. (If you are unable to go outside, gaze out the window at the natural world, the sky, the grass; or, look at something natural indoors). Tend to flowers, gardens, plants, trees. Admire the beauty and awe of nature. Receiving/Serving in Gratitude We give the gift of gratitude by receiving others’ offers of support and kindness. We give a gift of gratitude, too, by offering the beauty and softness of ourselves to others. Do RAOK (random acts of kindness). Accept others’ help and support. Share a meal. Volunteer (short-term, long-term, at a one-time event, frequently). Make some small gifts of beauty to give away: cards, small drawing/paintings, photos, found natural items, poetry (your own or others’), bookmarks. Share a powerful story with someone. Listen deeply to someone else’s story. Adversity and Gratitude Even in the murky depths of a major life transition; disease, illness, or injury; grief; globally unstable times; or adversity in myriad other forms, we can find small blessings. Write about a time you or someone you know overcame something similar to what you’re going through now. Get still and quiet in nature, feeling the vastness of it holding you. Find the smallest “positive” in the crisis. Stay present in this moment (easily done by watching your breath inhalation by exhalation). Again, these represent only a few of the basic practices I engage toward a more expressed life of gratefulness. I return to that rising sun photo and am delighted with the contrasts of crisp edges alongside blurred ones. The white ball enclosed by leaf silhouettes, tinted with red, edged in black, yellow highlights, green barely visible; these bold hues are not the colors I associate with gratitude. Yet, they create for me an unambiguous surrender to awe, to the miracle of daily life unfolding. It is both the ordinariness and the surprise that hold me enraptured. This is gratitude; this is inexplicable gratefulness of the sort that propels me farther and further into communion with all beings. I think this is the point of gratitude: remembering our inextricable interconnection with all of life, and savoring each moment that we are given by divine grace. Jennifer J. Wilhoit, PhD Jennifer J.

    "content": "The Secret to Serenity | Psychology Today Skip to main content There’s a saying that our serenity is inversely proportional to our expectations. In other words, the extent of our entitlement or need for things to look a certain way determines the extent of our unhappiness. This makes sense for the simple fact that when we focus on what we don’t have, we feel distraught and disappointed. Like all sayings, this one can lose its meaning over time. It becomes just a saying. And next to other sayings like “Dream Big” and “Anything is Possible,” the idea of limiting expectations can seem like it’s putting a lid on our dreams . Releasing expectations can feel like we are giving up, that we are “settling” and can simultaneously ignite all sorts of feelings associated with not getting what we want and the stories we tell ourselves about why that’s the case. But, letting go of expectations doesn’t mean giving up on life or our big dreams. These two notions are not mutually exclusive. We can have a calling and passion but also remember that achievement isn’t the secret to happiness . Clinging to a future version of our lives as a measure of our happiness is a losing proposition. And in my opinion, most of the time we don’t really know what’s best for ourselves. So, even our “big dreams” aren’t tailored to the sort of growth and development that will bring us real satisfaction in the long run. And this is just talking about how expectations impact our future. When we cling to what we think we know is best down the road, we lose out on what we are experiencing right now. When we are busy writing the end of the story before it’s finished, we can’t really see what is happening in the present. But when we loosen our grip and look around at our lives, we can start to see and experience what we already have. We can see that there is much to be grateful for. And it’s not a made up storyline—it’s reality. And it’s actually the only thing that we have—this present moment and the goodness that lies within it. So, if you are like me, you have some pretty big ideas about what the future should hold and are probably doing everything you can to make those things happen. This post is my friendly reminder to look around your life today to see how much of what you want already exists. Look for the good and you will surely find some. If you want to be an artist : look at what you are creating right now. Feel grateful for the inspiration that pours through you, even if it’s only for you and your best friend. Create something today. Use that gift and enjoy the impact it has on your life. Celebrate your artistry in this moment. If you want to find love : look at the love you already have in your life. It may not come in the package you were hoping for, but that doesn’t mean that love has passed you by. See not only where you are receiving love, but also how you can give it. Show up for the people you love today. Let them know how much they mean to you. Put a smile on their face (and see how it grows the love you feel). If you want more money : feel appreciation for the resources that you currently possess. Notice every dime that you spend today. Amplify your gratitude for having that dime to put in the meter. So much of our spending is mindless, and we wonder why we don’t feel the abundance we already have. Actively place your attention on what you have, and you will likely feel very rich. I’m not suggesting that we do these things as a gimmick so that we eventually get everything our hearts desire. It’s simply a matter of accepting life on life’s terms and appreciating the many gifts that we’ve already received. And that's the secret to serenity.

We share our triumphs but keep our tragedies to ourselves. When we experience emotionally difficult or devastating times in our lives, we are strongly advised to “get past it,” “get over it,” or—my very favorite—“move on,” even though, in many cases, it would be impossible to know how to “move on”—or where to move on to; there is simply no map for us to follow and no set mechanism through which to process the experience, as an individual or a community, so that we may have the closure everyone tells us we should seek. Collectively, we are guilty of sputtering this useless advice to each other because modern Western culture is no longer accustomed to the meaningful ritualization that allowed our wise ancestors to mark life’s transitions in healthy ways. When we focus solely on getting closure and putting the past behind us, rather than fully processing an event or life change, our human experience is minimized. Even our language encourages us to make less of things. For instance, our culture commonly refers to the psychologists who help us work through our experiences as “shrinks.” Why don’t we use the term “expansionist” instead, to promote the concept of opening rather than closure of our conscious self? If we opened ourselves to our experiences, good and bad, how much more could we learn from them, as individuals and as a society? Carl Jung, founder of analytical psychology, teaches that ceremony and ritual are essential for people to mark the important transitions of life. Without meaningful ritual, he tells us, people suffer. Ritual and ceremony can bridge our past and our present elegantly, making it possible for folks like you and me to travel through life, honoring the good and bad times we’ve been through. They can help us become human “well-beings,” ready to take on more life and liberty and ready to pursue our happiness. Rather than closure, I propose a new focus on “opening” and offer a mini-cleansing ritual to eliminate our focus on closure. I ask you to imagine a window, and open it wide. Then, pack the word “closure” and all the pressures to reach it into a tight little ball with your hands, like a snowball, and toss it out the window. Good job! You’ve now crossed the threshold and entered into a new enlightened space of your own creation, where you and others can experience “opening,” or anexi, the ancient Greek word that also refers to the beginning of the spring season. Through ritual and ceremony — small ones like this mini-cleansing or more elaborate ones — you can create for yourself, your family, and your community a special time and space to meditate and marinate with an experience that either has made a simple ripple in your life or has truly rocked your world. Ceremony is a noble and life-affirming way to mark rites of passage. You don’t have to worry if anyone else would consider what you’re honoring worthy of ceremony. What is important is its significance to you. We are used to typical womb-to-tomb ceremonies for birth, marriage, and death, but there is so much more to pay homage to between these events, and even these classic ceremonies have become commercialized rather than ritualized. Thoughtful ritual can give optimal meaning to life and guide you on a golden path to your new status in a life-affirming way. Here are a dozen kinds of rituals that you might want to bring into being, or use this list as inspiration to create a dozen more. 1. Healing and Transition Ceremony: This can be used for military personnel coming home to their families from the war, to honor and acknowledge their experiences and create a path on which they and their family can begin to reintegrate their lives together. 2. Bond-Strengthening Ceremony: A friendship weaving and/or a family mending ceremony can be used to restore friendship and bonds that have been weakened by actions, events, or just time and distance. 3. Rite of Passage for a New Teenager: A ceremony for an adolescent as he or she crosses the threshold to young adulthood. The ceremony can emphasize the teen’s journey, highlight work he or she has done (for example, volunteering in the community) to show readiness for this new status, and be a point at which the teenager is formally given new rights and responsibilities. 4. Whence We Came Ceremony: This ceremony is created to honor our ancestors—the people who made a lasting impression on our lives—and to pass their stories from one generation to the next. 5. Baby Naming/Welcoming Ceremony: This ceremony welcomes a new child into the family and the community. The ceremony honors the little one’s life. Family and friends attending and participating in the rituals state their intentions and promises of commitment, love, and support. The ceremony may be used to welcome babies or older children joining the family through adoption. 6. Tree-mendous Ceremony: A ceremony for the tree in your backyard that once stood tall for 100 years and is now being cut down. Dedicate and plant a new tree in its place, and celebrate the important moments your family shared beneath its branches. 7. Dwelling or Safe Haven Ceremony: Many people are familiar with housewarming ceremonies. This ceremony is to pay homage to a more temporary living space, to make it our own for the duration of our stay. This can include dwellings such as a new apartment, hotel room, prison, or college dormitory, as well as places in which we find ourselves in times of need, such as a temporary shelter. 8. New Beginning Ceremony: To celebrate a new year, business, or organization, or a new way of living, such as going back to school or starting a new career. 9. Wisdom Ceremony: To honor the elders in our community and to pass on their knowledge and experience. 10. Uncoupling Ceremony: A ceremony to honor, with dignity and compassion, divorce, separation, or disbanding of a group, team, or organization. 11. Animal Companion Ceremony: To honor the animals in our lives—pets at home, working animals, sporting animals, or those in zoos or in captivity. 12. Survivor Ceremony: To commemorate surviving an illness or tragic event and to help the survivor’s or victim’s transition to “normal” life by giving him the opportunity to shed light on his experience and to thank those whose support helped him through it.

    "content": "5 Ways Rituals Help Guide You Through Transitions | Psychology Today Skip to main content You may be wondering what rituals have to do with change and transition, since many of us think of ritual as something primarily connected to religion. While this is true, ritual goes well beyond the prayers and ceremonies usually associated with religion. When you set a clear intention and are fully engaged on every level—spiritually, emotionally, physically, and psychologically—all rituals are meaningful. In other words, when they're \"alive\" for you personally, rituals connect you to something larger than yourself. While most of us connect with change and transition on an intellectual level (since the process of moving through change is often logical, practical, and linear), the better approach might include both practical and creative elements. So while we seek practical solutions, we also want to give credence and voice to the intuitive, imaginative parts of our self, and to the process of change itself. Rituals are symbolic enactments that represent what change really means to you personally and as such, are powerful tools that help transform you through transition. So here are five significant ways to think about how rituals can help you creatively move through change and transition. Rituals awaken that which is eternal within you and show you how your individual life is part of a much grander design. Rituals connect you with nature and the seasons. The ongoing transitions that occur in nature provide the prototype for change. By watching the constant shifts and turns in nature you can recognize your own cycles of life, your own rhythms as a human. Rituals remind you of the interconnectedness of all of life. Rituals connect you to your ancestors and to your heritage. Their creation and performance help you to understand where you came from. As a bridge between past and future, they enable you to access, honor, and strengthen your own identity . Rituals provide an ongoing way to structure your life. They help you find and define the patterns and cycles in your individual life that might otherwise appear to be random happenings if viewed separately. The ritual process provides a sense of stability and continuity amidst the ever-changing, hectic and often chaotic world in which we all live. Rituals engender a sense of healing calm and a feeling of trust in life's flow and forward movement. Rituals remove you from the ordinary flow of life and place you in sacred space. It is outside the realm of ordinary space and time that rituals create their magic through the mystical language of symbolic reenactment. Rituals carry you into deeper levels of consciousness. By engaging all of your senses through the creative use of ritual elements inherent in the process, you're able to bypass the intellect in favor of your intuitive, instinctive knowing. Rituals help you balance the work of your outer and inner lives and allow for the full expression of your soul and spirit. Rituals give meaning to your journey and a sense of purpose to your life. Rituals provide you with a sense of renewal. They offer a time-out from your everyday routine, habitual existence. In ritual you have the opportunity to rest, replenish, and restore your self on your journey through life. The ongoing creation and performance of rituals prepares you for the next stages of life, helping you to reevaluate your journey thus far and to reaffirm that the path you're traveling is the right one for you. Rituals that mark \"rites of passage\" — major transitional turning points — help you \"connect the dots.\" The classic rite of passage is a universal structuring device existing within virtually every culture. Major life events that honor changes in status or identity within any given society are marked by the three-fold process of separation, transition, and incorporation. You separate from the familiar, transition through unknown territory, and return, transformed by the process. While all rituals have the potential to transport you to that timeless place, rites of passage have the unique power to transform . So transformative are rites of passage that even a single one can divide one's life into \"before and after.\" And successive passage rites for life transitions can help organize and define one's entire life. By creating and performing personally expressive rituals for your self you move freely into your own spiritual life, taking charge of marking and honoring the transitions, the special moments in your life that you find significant, in ways you find personally meaningful. Rituals are tools that give you the freedom to take responsibility for the direction and purpose of your life.

    "content": "Does Nature Make Us Happy? | Psychology Today Skip to main content In today’s age of high technology, research shows that our hunger for the natural world still endures. In fact, our connections with nature could just be the best medicine for people of all ages—improving our health, happiness , and well-being. Those same connections could also heal the planet. Few would disagree that our natural and cognitive worlds have grown disconnected. Most of us, particularly children, spend far less time in nature today than in recent decades. There are no required classes in nature connectedness in our schools, nor is nature a well-utilized tool for teaching kids to critically think about the world around them. New research, however, suggests our relationship with nature may be deeply linked to our happiness. We don’t have to look far into history to know that humans evolved in natural settings and were deeply connected to their ecological environments. In the 18 th century, poet and writer, Samuel Johnson, wisely stated, “Deviation from nature is deviation from happiness.” Could those natural settings not only become an avenue by which we find happiness in the 21 st century, but also provide new psychological insights that help motivate generations toward environmental sustainability? Several particularly interesting studies were published recently in Environment and Behavior by John Zelenski and Elizabeth Nisbet. Not surprisingly, the studies found that our emotional connections with nature are predictive of our attitudes and the choices we make about living sustainable lifestyles. But in addition, the study also found a unique connection between nature and happiness itself. The Link between Nature and Happiness Zelenski and Nisbet conducted two studies with one question in mind: Is the link between nature and happiness independent from the other things that make us feel emotionally connected to life, like family, country, culture, music, and friends? In the first study, they measured people’s feelings of connectedness across many spheres, including nature. They called the concept of how we emotionally connect to our natural world nature relatedness . Using a Likert-type scale, participants rated their nature relatedness by their level of agreement or disagreement with statements like “My relationship to nature is an important part of who I am,” and “I take notice of wildlife wherever I am.” Other scales and inventories were used to rate people’s subjective happiness across these same areas. The result? Among the various happiness scales, the relationship between nature and happiness was highly significant. One of the primary goals of the study “was to determine whether the association between nature relatedness and happiness is due to a general sense of connectedness or a more specific link with nature.” In other words, the researchers wanted to know if nature stood out from other things that made us feel connected to life and gave us a sense of happiness. The results of their research suggest that “nature relatedness has a distinct happiness benefit” beyond the more generalized benefit of feeling connected to family, friends, and home. Our connection to nature also correlated with most measures of human well-being, indicating it may play an extremely important role in maintaining positive mental health. To further understand and expand the findings of the first study, Zelenski and Nisbet conducted a 2 nd study. In this study they used well-validated assessments to more deeply explore various connections to happiness, particularly those of an interpersonal quality, including attachment , interdependence, and belongingness. Not only did they hope to replicate the findings from Study 1, but they also wanted to see if nature relatedness could actually predict happiness. Important Findings on Nature Relatedness While not every correlation between nature and happiness could be duplicated in the second study, the general pattern of findings and ensuing comparison to past studies led researchers to important conclusions, including: Our emotional connectedness to the natural world is distinct from other psychological connections in our lives. Nature relatedness often predicts happiness regardless of other psychological factors. Psychological connections with nature have the capacity to facilitate sustainable attitudes, and may be an important tool in preserving our environment. Ecopsychology and the Future of Planet Earth While these studies provide insightful data on the relationship of nature and happiness, they build on many previous studies that link our health and well-being to the natural world. In fact, a whole new field of ecopsychology has emerged, combining the efforts of ecologists, psychologists, spiritualists, philosophers, and others. The International Community for Ecopsychology says, “Ecopsychology explores the synergistic relation between personal health and well-being and the health and well-being of our home, the Earth.” Happiness Essential Reads The Hidden Cost of Happiness 5 Benefits of Sharing Your Life With a Dog Many experts have sounded the alarm about our disconnection from the natural world, from the Industrial Revolution onward. But the Digital Age evokes additional concerns. Richard Louv, in his award winning book, Last Child in the Woods: Saving Our Children from Nature-Deficit Disorder , linked the lack of nature in the lives of today’s wired generation to troubling childhood trends, including the rise of obesity and depression . A 2005 study by the American Institutes for Research found that kids who learn in outdoor classrooms improve their science scores by 27 percent. Great Blue Heron Nests Not only have experts found that outdoor education is critical for child development , it is also important for the future of the planet. Why? Because when we feel connected to nature, we are more likely to live sustainable lifestyles. We are also more likely to support environmental causes that educate and engage others with the natural world. How should studies like these affect our actions in the world? While I consider myself deeply connected to nature already, these studies motivated me to take a walk in my neighborhood with new eyes. Not only did I engage differently with the many blossoming trees, but I discovered 15 Great Blue Heron nests in a tree within a block of my home. I had been walking by them for days, but had never looked up! The thrill of seeing each nest topped with a large heron definitely increased my happiness! It showed me that there is much more to learn and many more ways to engage with the many living organisms around us. Let’s get our children and teenagers out in the natural world and engage them with its beauty and vibrant spirit. In the end, it is their and our relationships with nature that will determine our futures. How would you describe your own connection with nature? Your children's? Do those relationships with the natural world bring happiness to your lives? References American Institutes for Research (AIR) (2005).

    "content": "Finding Flow | Psychology Today Skip to main content Finding Flow Reviews the book 'Finding Flow,' by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. By Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi published July 1, 1997 - last reviewed on June 4, 2025 Share Tweet Share on Bluesky Share Email We all are capable of reaching that stateof effortless concentration and enjoyment called \"flow.\" Here, the man who literally wrote the book on flow presents his most lucid account yet of how to experience this blissful state. IMAGINE THAT YOU ARE SKIING DOWN A SLOPE and your full attention is focused on the movements of your body and your full attention is focused on the movements of your body, the position of the skis, the air whistling past your face, and the snow-shrouded trees running by. There is no room in your awareness for conflicts or contradictions; you know that a distracting thought or emotion might get you buried face down in the snow. The run is so perfect that you want it to last forever. If skiing does not mean much to you, this complete immersion in an experience could occur while you are singing in a choir, dancing, playing bridge, or reading a good book. If you love your job, it could happen during a complicated surgical operation or a close business deal. It may occur in a social interaction, when talking with a good friend, or while playing with a baby. Moments such as these provide flashes of intense living against the dull background of everyday life. These exceptional moments are what I have called \"flow\" experiences. The metaphor of flow is one that many people have used to describe the sense of effortless action they feel in moments that stand out as the best in their lives. Athletes refer to it as \"being in the zone,\" religious mystics as being in \"ecstasy,\" artists and musicians as \"aesthetic rapture.\" It is the full involvement of flow, rather than happiness , that makes for excellence in life. We can be happy experiencing the passive pleasure of a rested body, warm sunshine, or the contentment of a serene relationship, but this kind of happiness is dependent on favorable external circumstances. The happiness that follows flow is of our own making, and it leads to increasing complexity and growth in consciousness. WHERE TO FIND FLOW Flow tends to occur when a person faces a clear set of goals that require appropriate responses. It is easy to enter flow in games such as chess, tennis, or poker, because they have goals and rules that make it possible for the player to act without questioning what should be done, and how. For the duration of the game the player lives in a self-contained universe where everything is black and white. The same clarity of goals is present if you perform a religious ritual, play a musical piece, weave a rug, write a computer program, climb a mountain, or perform surgery. In contrast to normal life, these \"flow activities\" allow a person to focus on goals that are clear and compatible, and provide immediate feedback. Flow also happens when a person's skills are fully involved in overcoming a challenge that is just about manageable, so it acts as a magnet for learning new skills and increasing challenges. If challenges are too low, one gets back to flow by increasing them. If challenges are too great, one can return to the flow state by learning new skills. How often do people experience flow? If you ask a sample of typical Americans, \"Do you ever get involved in something so deeply that nothing else seems to matter and you lose track of time?\" roughly one in five will say that this happens to them as much as several times a day, whereas about 15 percent will say that this never happens to them. These frequencies seem to he quite stable and universal. For instance, in a recent survey of 6,469 Germans, the same question was answered in the following way: Often, 23 percent; Sometimes, 40 percent; Rarely, 25 percent; Never or Don't Know, 12 percent. A more precise way to study flow is the Experience Sampling Method, or ESM, which I developed at the University of Chicago in the early 1970s. This method provides a virtual filmstrip of a person's daily activities and experiences. At the signal of a pager or watch, which goes off at random times within each two-hour segment of the day, a person writes down in a booklet where she is, what she is doing, what she is thinking about, and whom she is with, then she rates her state of consciousness on various numerical scales. At our Chicago laboratory, we have collected over the years a total of 70,000 pages from about 2,300 respondents. Investigators in other parts of the world have more than tripled these figures. The ESM has found that flow generally occurs when a person is doing his or her favorite activity--gardening, listening to music, bowling, cooking a good meal. It also occurs when driving, talking to friends, and surprisingly often at work. Very rarely do people report flow in passive leisure activities, such as watching television or relaxing. Almost any activity can produce flow provided the relevant elements are present, so it is possible to improve the quality of life by making sure that the conditions of flow are a constant part of everyday life. FLOW AT WORK Although adults tend to be less happy than average while working, and their motivation is considerably below normal, ESM studies find more occasions of flow on the job than in free time. This finding is not that surprising: Work is much more like a game than most other things we do during the day. It usually has clear goals and rules of performance. It provides feedback either in the form of knowing that one has finished a job well done, in terms of measurable sales or through an evaluation by one's supervisor. A job tends to encourage concentration and prevent distractions, and ideally, its difficulties match the worker's skills. Nevertheless, if we had the chance most of us would like to work less. One reason is the historical disrepute of work, which each of us learn as we grow up. Yet we can't blame family, society, or history if our work is meaningless, dull, or stressful . Admittedly, there are few options when we realize that our job is useless or actually harmful. Perhaps the only choice is to quit as quickly as possible, even at the cost of severe financial hardship. In terms of the bottom line of one's life, it is always better to do something one feels good about than something that may make us materially comfortable but emotionally miserable. Such decisions are notoriously difficult and require great honesty with oneself. Short of making such a dramatic switch, there are many ways to make one's job produce flow. A supermarket clerk who pays genuine attention to customers, a physician concerned about the total well-being of patients, or a news reporter who considers truth at least as important as sensational interest when writing a story, can transform a routine job into one that makes a difference. Turning a dull jot into one that satisfies our need for novelty and achievement involves paying close attention to each step involved, and then asking: Is this step necessary? Can it be done better, faster, more efficiently? What additional steps could make my contribution more valuable? If, instead of spending a lot of effort trying to cut corners, one spent the same amount of attention trying to find ways to accomplish more on the job, one would enjoy working--more and probably be more successful. When approached without too many cultural prejudices and with a determination to make it personally meaningful, even the most mundane job can produce flow. The same type of approach is needed for solving the problem of stress at work. First, establish priorities among the demands that crowd into consciousness. Successful people often make lists or flowcharts of all the things they have to do, and quickly decide which tasks they can delegate or forget, and which ones they have to tackle personally, and in what order. The next step is to match one's skills with whatever challenges have been identified. There will be tasks we feel incompetent to deal with. Can you learn the skills required in time? Can you get help? Can the task be transformed, or broken into simpler parts? Usually the answer to one of these questions will provide a solution;that transforms a potentially stressful situation into a flow experience. FLOW AT PLAY In comparison to work, people often lack a clear purpose when spending time at home with the family or alone. The popular assumption is that no skills are involved in enjoying free time, and that anybody can do it. Yet the evidence suggests the opposite: Free time is more difficult to enjoy than work. Apparently, our nervous system has evolved to attend to external signals, but has not had time to adapt to long periods without obstacles and dangers. Unless one learns how to use this time effectively, having leisure at one's disposal does not improve the quality of life. Leisure time in our society is occupied by three major sorts of activities: media consumption, conversation, and active leisure--such as hobbies, making music, going to restaurants and movies, sports, and exercise. Not all of these free-time activities are the same in their potential for flow. For example, U.S. teenagers experience flow about 13 percent of the time that they spend watching television, 34 percent of the time they do hobbies, and 44 percent of the time they are involved in sports and games. Yet these same teenagers spend at least four times more of their free hours watching TV than doing hobbies or sports. Similar ratios are true for adults. Why would we spend four times more of our free time doing something that has less than half the chance of making us feel good? Each of the flow-producing activities requires an initial investment of attention before it begins to be enjoyable. If a person is too tired, anxious, or lacks the discipline to overcome that initial obstacle, he or she will have to settle for something that, although less enjoyable, is more accessible. It is not that relaxing is had. Everyone needs time to unwind, to read trashy novels, to sit on the. couch staring into space or watching TV What matters is the dosage. In a large-scale study in Germany, it was found that the more often people report reading books, the more flow experiences they claim to have, while the opposite trend was found for watching television. To make the best use of free time, one needs to devote as much ingenuity and attention to it as one would to one's job. Active leisure that helps a person grow does not come easily. In fact, before science and the arts became professionalized, a great deal of scientific research, poetry, painting, and musical composition was carried out in a person's free time. And all folk--art the songs, fabrics, pottery, and carvings that give each culture its particular identity and renown--is the result of common people striving to express their best skill in the time left free from work and maintenance chores. Only lack of imagination , or lack of energy, stand in the way of each of us becoming a poet or musician, an inventor or explorer, an amateur scholar, scientist, artist, or collector. SOCIAL FLOW Of all the things we do, interaction with others is the least predictable. At one moment we experience flow, the next apathy, anxiety , relaxation, or boredom . Over and over, however, our findings suggest that people get depressed when they are alone, and that they revive when they rejoin the company of others. The moods that people with chronic depression or eating disorders experience are indistinguishable from those of healthy people as long as they are in company and doing something that requires concentration. But when they are alone with nothing to do, their minds begin to be occupied by depressing thoughts, and their consciousness becomes scattered. This is also true, to a less pronounced extent, of everyone else. The reason is that when we have to interact with another person, even stranger, our attention becomes structured by external demands. In more intimate encounters, the level of both challenges and skills can grow very high. Thus, interactions have many of the characteristics of flow activities, and they certainly require the orderly investment of mental energy. The strong effects of companionship on the quality of experience suggest that investing energy in relationships is a good way to improve life. A successful interaction involves finding some compatibility between our goals and those of the other person or persons, and becoming willing to invest attention in the other person's goals. When these conditions are met, it is possible to experience the flow that comes from optimal interaction. For example, to experience the simple pleasures of parenting , one has to pay attention, to know what the child is \"proud of\" or \"into\"; then to share those activities with her. The same holds true for any other type of interaction. The secret of starting a good conversation is to find out what the other person's goals are: What is he interested in at the moment? What is she involved in? What has he or she accomplished, or is trying to accomplish? If any of this sounds worth pursuing, the next step is to utilize one's own experience or expertise on the topics raised by the other person--without trying to take over the conversation, but developing it jointly. A good conversation is like a jam session in jazz, where one starts with conventional elements and then introduces spontaneous variations that create an exciting new composition. OVERCOMING OBSTACLES A deprived childhood , abusive parents, poverty, and a host of other external reasons may make it difficult for a person to find joy in everyday life. On the other hand, there are so many examples of individuals who overcame such obstacles that the belief that the quality of life is determined from the outside is hardly tenable. How much stress we experience depends more on how well we control attention than on what happens to us. The effect of physical pain, a monetary loss, or a social snub depends on how much attention we pay to it. To deny, repress, or misinterpret such events is no solution either, because the information will keep smoldering in the recesses of the mind. It is better to look suffering straight in the eye, acknowledge and respect its presence, and then get busy as soon as possible focusing on things we choose to focus on. To learn to control attention, any skill or discipline one can master on one's own will serve: meditation and prayer, exercise, aerobics, martial arts. The important thing is to enjoy the activity for its own sake, and to know that what matters is not the result, but the control one is acquiring over one's attention. It is also important to develop the habit of doing whatever needs to be done with concentrated attention. Even the most routine tasks, like washing dishes, dressing, or mowing the lawn, become more rewarding if we approach them with the care it would take to make a work of art. We must then transfer some psychic energy each day from tasks that we don't like doing, or from passive leisure, into something we never did before, or something we enjoy doing but don't do often enough because it seems too much trouble. This sounds simple, but many people have no idea which components of their lives they actually enjoy. Keeping a diary or reflecting on the past day in the evening are ways to take stock systematically of the various influences on one's moods. After it is clear which activities produce the high points in one's day, it becomes possible to start experimenting, by increasing the frequency of the positive ones and decreasing that of others. To make a creative change in the quality of experience, it might be useful to experiment with one's surroundings as well. Outings and vacations help to clear the mind, to change perspectives, to look at one's situation with a fresh eye. Taking charge of one's home or office environment--throwing out the excess, redecorating to one's taste, making it personally and psychologically comfortable--could be the first step in reordering one's life. With time of day as with the other parameters of life, it is important to find out what rhythms are the most congenial to you personally. There is no day or hour that is best for everyone. Experimenting with various alternatives--getting up earlier, taking a nap in the afternoon, eating at different times--helps one to find the best set of options. Many people will say that this advice is useless to them, because they already have so many demands on their time that they absolutely cannot afford to do anything new or interesting. But more often than not, time stress is an excuse for not taking control of one's life. As the historian E. P. Thompson noted, even in the most oppressive decades of the Industrial Revolution, when workers slaved away for more than 80 hours a week, some spent their few precious free hours engaging in literary pursuits or political action instead of following the majority into the pubs. Likewise, we don't have to let time run through our fingers. How many of our demands could be reduced if we put some energy into prioritizing, organizing, and streamlining the routines that now fritter away our attention? One must learn to husband time carefully, in order to enjoy life in the here and now. FINDING A GOAL Flow is a source of mental energy in that it focuses attention and motivates action. Like other forms of energy, it can be used for constructive or destructive purposes. Teenagers arrested for vandalism or robbery often have no other motivation than the excitement they experience stealing a car or breaking into a house. War veterans say that they never felt such intense flow as when they were behind a machine gun on the front lines. Thus, it is not enough to strive for enjoyable goals, but one must also choose goals that will reduce the sum total of entropy in the world. How can we find a goal that will allow us to enjoy life while being responsible to others? Buddhists advise us to \"act always as if the future of the universe depended on what you did, while laughing at yourself for thinking that whatever you do makes any difference.\" This serious playfulness makes it possible to be both engaged and carefree at the same time. We may also discover the foundations on which to build a good life from the knowledge scientists are slowly accumulating. The findings of science makes us increasingly aware of how unique each person is. Not only in the way the ingredients of the genetic code have been combined, but also in the time and place in which an organism encounters life. Thus each of us is responsible for one particular point in space and time in which our body and mind forms a link within the total network of existence. We can focus consciousness on the tasks of everyday life in the knowledge that when we act in the fullness of the flow experience, we are also building a bridge to the future of the universe.

    "content": "Aliveness - Grateful.org Light a Candle Send an eCard Private Journal Brother David Article Nicos Hadjicostis Share Dedicated to Brother David Steindl-Rast who turned 90 years young on July 12, 2016. Sometimes people get the mistaken notion that spirituality is a separate department of life, the penthouse of our existence. But rightly understood, it is a vital awareness that pervades all realms of our being. Someone will say, “I come alive when I listen to music,” or “I come to life when I garden,” or “I come alive when I play golf.” Wherever we come alive, that is the area in which we are spiritual. – From Br. David Steindl-Rast’s – Music of Silence , p.64 We are all alive; but how Alive are we? Breathing, eating, and sleeping, places us in the category of living organisms of the animal kingdom. We all pertain by default to this being-aliveness. We exist, we are alive – still. But all of us know that there is another aliveness that goes beyond our vital functions and which, of course, only conscious living beings can experience: Aliveness – with a capital “a”. This happens when our life becomes magnified, attenuated. We experience, as Brother David Steindl-Rast says, a vitality, an awakeness, an awareness, that makes our being-alive joyous. When we become consumed by this spirit of Aliveness, we sometimes say “I feel so alive today!” Our life becomes extraordinary and we know in the depths of our being that Life has a value and worth that far surpasses the mere being-alive. It is our focusing, our present-moment awareness, that causes each event of our lives to express its extraordinariness and shine. When we carefully examine “the how and when” of this Aliveness, we see that it is most often the result of two things: of being in the present moment and doing something we love doing. As I write in my book Destination Earth , being fully immersed in the present moment has been an ideal of many religious and philosophical traditions. It has been a central part of Buddhist, Hindu, and Christian meditative practices for millennia, and it has been given many different names, such as mindfulness or awareness. More recently, it has been discussed in depth by Eckhart Tolle, who called it “The Power of Now.” The ideal is to be in the Now regardless of what one does – even during the most repetitive and boring activities. Being in the present moment does not mean that one is constantly in meditative repose or continually feeling something special or having peak experiences. Actually, it is something quite ordinary. Every person experiences this. When one concentrates on important work or creates something meaningful which absorbs him completely, or when one is captivated by a piece of art or music, he is fully present in the now. In rarer and more extraordinary situations, such as a natural catastrophe, war, or other immediate danger, this experience is even more pronounced. When someone must fight for his life, or exert overwhelming effort under time pressure, he exists wholly in the present moment. In such situations, we often say that time stops because it seems that the person has exited the normal experience of the flow of time. Probably, the common and crucial element in all of the above instances of being in the present moment is self-forgetfulness. Immersed with all of our senses in what happens right this minute, we become self-forgetful and absolutely focused in whatever we do or experience. It is while being in this “mode of being” that we create something of value, or experience Life at its full. We can train ourselves to be more mindful when we do what we apparently do not like. Then we will discover pleasures in what we have become used to doing mechanically. The second element is doing something we love doing. As the quote above says, we are more Alive when we love what we do – for example during the preoccupation with our hobbies. Many people look forward to the work-day’s end that they may then enjoy what … they “enjoy doing.” However, this need not be so. For we can train ourselves to be more mindful when we do what we apparently do not like. Then we will discover pleasures in what we have become used to doing mechanically. When talking about Gratefulness, Brother David likes to say: “It is to the extent to which we are grateful that we are happy and not the other way around.” I often feel that this can also be applied to Aliveness: It is to the extent that we are Alive that life becomes extraordinary and not the other way around. Maybe the events of our life are not divided naturally into ordinary and extraordinary. Maybe most of the events of our lives are extraordinary, and it is because of the absence of awareness and the lack of Aliveness that we come to experience ordinariness, boredom, or weariness. It is our focusing, our present-moment awareness, that causes each event of our lives to express its extraordinariness and shine. Although we may be in continuous awe and fully Alive while exploring the Grand Canyon, maybe our daily commuting route is also extraordinary, but we have shut down our senses and do not see it. We miss the route’s seasonal or daily changes, its constant metamorphoses, the wealth of little unique events that happen in it every day, because we drive unconsciously and our mind wonders to other things. Being Alive is a very serious thing to be left to chance. Just as we strive to achieve a million other goals in life, let us infuse our life with Aliveness that will in turn permeate everything we do and all that we become.

Request Appointment Products and services Stress relief from laughter? It's no joke When it comes to relieving stress, more giggles and guffaws are just what the doctor ordered. Here's why. By Mayo Clinic Staff Whether you're guffawing at a sitcom on TV or quietly giggling at a newspaper cartoon, laughing does you good. Laughter is a great form of stress relief, and that's no joke. Stress relief from laughter A good sense of humor can't cure all ailments, but data is mounting about the positive things laughter can do. Short-term benefits A good laugh has great short-term effects. When you start to laugh, it doesn't just lighten your load mentally, it actually induces physical changes in your body. Laughter can: Stimulate many organs. Laughter enhances your intake of oxygen-rich air, stimulates your heart, lungs and muscles, and increases the endorphins that are released by your brain. Activate and relieve your stress response. A rollicking laugh fires up and then cools down your stress response, and it can increase and then decrease your heart rate and blood pressure. The result? A good, relaxed feeling. Soothe tension. Laughter can also stimulate circulation and aid muscle relaxation, both of which can help reduce some of the physical symptoms of stress. Long-term effects Laughter isn't just a quick pick-me-up, though. It's also good for you over the long term. Laughter may: Improve your immune system. Negative thoughts manifest into chemical reactions that can affect your body by bringing more stress into your system and decreasing your immunity. By contrast, positive thoughts can actually release neuropeptides that help fight stress and potentially more-serious illnesses. Relieve pain. Laughter may ease pain by causing the body to produce its own natural painkillers. Increase personal satisfaction. Laughter can also make it easier to cope with difficult situations. It also helps you connect with other people. Improve your mood. Many people experience depression, sometimes due to chronic illnesses. Laughter can help lessen your stress, depression and anxiety and may make you feel happier. It can also improve your self-esteem. Improve your sense of humor Are you afraid that you have an underdeveloped — or nonexistent — sense of humor? No problem. Humor can be learned. In fact, developing or refining your sense of humor may be easier than you think. Put humor on your horizon. Find a few simple items, such as photos, greeting cards or comic strips, that make you chuckle. Then hang them up at home or in your office, or collect them in a file or notebook. Keep funny movies, TV shows, books, magazines or comedy videos on hand for when you need an added humor boost. Look online at joke websites or silly videos. Listen to humorous podcasts. Go to a comedy club. Laugh and the world laughs with you. Find a way to laugh about your own situations and watch your stress begin to fade away. Even if it feels forced at first, practice laughing. It does your body good. Consider trying laughter yoga. In laughter yoga, people practice laughter as a group. Laughter is forced at first, but it can soon turn into spontaneous laughter. Share a laugh. Make it a habit to spend time with friends who make you laugh. And then return the favor by sharing funny stories or jokes with those around you. Knock, knock. Browse through your local bookstore or library's selection of joke books and add a few jokes to your list that you can share with friends. Know what isn't funny. Don't laugh at the expense of others. Some forms of humor aren't appropriate. Use your best judgment to discern a good joke from a bad or hurtful one. Laughter is the best medicine Go ahead and give it a try. Turn the corners of your mouth up into a smile and then give a laugh, even if it feels a little forced. Once you've had your chuckle, take stock of how you're feeling. Are your muscles a little less tense? Do you feel more relaxed or buoyant? That's the natural wonder of laughing at work.

Compassion is not the same as empathy or altruism , though the concepts are related. While empathy refers more generally to our ability to take the perspective of and feel the emotions of another person, compassion is when those feelings and thoughts include the desire to help. Altruism, in turn, is the kind, selfless behavior often prompted by feelings of compassion, though one can feel compassion without acting on it, and altruism isn’t always motivated by compassion. While cynics may dismiss compassion as touchy-feely or irrational, scientists have started to map the biological basis of compassion, suggesting its deep evolutionary purpose . This research has shown that when we feel compassion, our heart rate slows down, we secrete the “bonding hormone” oxytocin, and regions of the brain linked to empathy , caregiving , and feelings of pleasure light up, which often results in our wanting to approach and care for other people.

The Greater Good Guide to Aging Well By Greater Good Editors | July 31, 2025 We’ve gathered the best and most enduring of our articles, podcasts, and videos about getting older. Scientific research into the measurable benefits of compassion is young. Preliminary findings suggest, however, that being compassionate can improve health, well-being, and relationships. Many scientists believe that compassion may even be vital to the survival of our species , and they’re finding that its advantages can be increased through targeted exercises and practice. Here are some of the most exciting findings from this research so far. Compassion makes us feel good: Compassionate action (e.g., giving to charity) activates pleasure circuits in the brain, and compassion training programs, even very brief ones, strengthen brain circuits for pleasure and reward and lead to lasting increases in self-reported happiness . Being compassionate—tuning in to other people in a kind and loving manner—can reduce risk of heart disease by boosting the positive effects of the Vagus Nerve , which helps to slow our heart rate . One compassion training program has found that it makes people more resilient to stress; it lowers stress hormones in the blood and saliva and strengthens the immune response. Compassion training may also help us worry less and be more open to our negative emotions. Compassion could improve our mental health : One research review found that practicing compassion meditation improved participants’ emotional life, positive thinking, relationships, and empathy. Brain scans during loving-kindness meditation, which directs compassion toward suffering, suggest that, on average, compassionate people’s minds wander less about what has gone wrong in their lives, or might go wrong in the future; as a result, they’re happier. Practicing compassion could make us more altruistic . In turn, it may also help us overcome empathic distress and become more resilient in the face of others’ suffering. Compassion helps make caring parents: Brain scans show that when people experience compassion, their brains activate in neural systems known to support parental nurturance and other caregiving behaviors. Compassion helps make better spouses: Compassionate people are more optimistic and supportive when communicating with others. Compassion helps make better friends: Studies of college friendships show that when one friend sets the goal to support the other compassionately, both friends experience greater satisfaction and growth in the relationship. Compassion helps make better doctors: Medical students who train in compassion feel less depressed and lonely, and avoid the typical declines in compassion that happen during medical school. Feeling compassion for one person makes us less vindictive toward others . Restraining feelings of compassion chips away at our commitment to moral principles. Employees who receive more compassion in their workplace see themselves, their co-workers, and their organization in a more positive light, report feeling more positive emotions like joy and contentment, and are more committed to their jobs. A compassionate workplace culture is linked to less burnout, greater teamwork, and higher job satisfaction. More compassionate societies —those that take care of their most vulnerable members, assist other nations in need, and have children who perform more acts of kindness—are the happier ones . Compassionate people are more socially adept, making them less vulnerable to loneliness; loneliness has been shown to cause stress and harm the immune system . The Trouble With Self-Love By Katherine Reynolds Lewis | August 26, 2025 Self-love is hard to define and measure—and for some scholars, that’s a good reason to keep studying the concept. Teens Need Compassion to Go with Mindfulness By Tyralynn Frazier , Blake Colaianne | August 21, 2025 Research suggests that mindfulness alone doesn't always work in kids and teens. Here’s what to try instead. Eight Ways to Support Your Employees in Uncertain Times By Shanna B. Tiayon | August 7, 2025 Uncertainty can be distressing.

How to Find Support in Difficult Times By Beth Kurland | August 4, 2025 When we experience rough roads ahead, finding others to support us can make all the difference. The Greater Good Guide to Aging Well By Greater Good Editors | July 31, 2025 We’ve gathered the best and most enduring of our articles, podcasts, and videos about getting older. We often talk about some people as being more compassionate than others, but research suggests compassion isn’t something you’re born with or not. Instead, it can be strengthened through targeted exercises and practice. Here are some specific, science-based activities for cultivating compassion from our new site Greater Good in Action : Feeling supported: Think about the people you turn to when you’re distressed and recall times when you’ve felt comforted by them, which research says can help us to feel more compassionate toward others. Compassion meditation: Cultivate compassion toward a loved one, yourself, a neutral person, and even an enemy. Put a human face on suffering: When reading the news, look for profiles of specific individuals and try to imagine what their lives have been like. Eliciting altruism: Create reminders of connectedness. Compassion training programs , such as those out of Emory University and Stanford University , are revealing how we can boost feelings of compassion in ourselves and others. Here are some of the best tips to emerge out of those programs, as well as other research. Look for commonalities: Seeing yourself as similar to others increases feelings of compassion. A recent study shows that something as simple as tapping your fingers to the same rhythm with a stranger increases compassionate behavior. Calm your inner worrier: When we let our mind run wild with fear in response to someone else’s pain (e.g., What if that happens to me?), we inhibit the biological systems that enable compassion. The practice of mindfulness can help us feel safer in these situations, facilitating compassion . Encourage cooperation, not competition, even through subtle cues: A seminal study showed that describing a game as a “Community Game” led players to cooperate and share a reward evenly; describing the same game as a “Wall Street Game” made the players more cutthroat and less honest. This is a valuable lesson for teachers, who can promote cooperative learning in the classroom. See people as individuals (not abstractions) : When presented with an appeal from an anti-hunger charity, people were more likely to give money after reading about a starving girl than after reading statistics on starvation—even when those statistics were combined with the girl’s story. Don’t play the blame game: When we blame others for their misfortune, we feel less tenderness and concern toward them. Respect your inner hero: When we think we’re capable of making a difference , we’re less likely to curb our compassion. Notice and savor how good it feels to be compassionate. Studies have shown that practicing compassion and engaging in compassionate action bolsters brain activity in areas that signal reward . To cultivate compassion in kids, start by modeling kindness: Research suggests compassion is contagious , so if you want to help compassion spread in the next generation of young men and women, lead by example. Curb inequality: Research suggests that as people feel a greater sense of status over others , they feel less compassion. Don’t be a sponge : When we completely take on other people’s suffering as our own, we risk feeling personally distressed, threatened, and overwhelmed; in some cases, this can even lead to burnout . Instead, try to be receptive to other people’s feelings without adopting those feelings as your own.

Use TV shows, commercial breaks, or radio ads to remember to eat or drink. Eat a bedtime snack. Tips about when and what to drink: Drink liquids between meals to help you stay hydrated. During meals, sip only small amounts of fluids so you can eat more food. Drink milkshakes, smoothies, juices, or soups if you do not feel like eating solid foods. Use whole milk or yogurt for milkshakes or smoothies to increase calories. Sip on nutrition supplement drinks between meals. Examples include Ensure and Boost. Meal prep tips: Make and store small amounts of your favorite foods so they are ready to eat. Add full-fat cheese to toast, eggs, crackers, soups, pasta, and potatoes. Add creamy sauces to pasta and other dishes. Add leftover meat to eggs, salad, pasta, and soups. Add beans and lentils to soup, salad, pasta, tacos, and casseroles.

Medicine to manage appetite loss from cancer and cancer treatment If you are not able to keep your appetite up, talk with your doctor about appetite stimulants. These are medicines that increase appetite and can cause weight gain. Increased appetite, weight gain, and cancer Although many people with cancer have appetite loss and lose weight, you may gain weight during cancer treatment. Weight gain is more common if you have ovarian , breast , or prostate cancer . Each person is different, so even if you have one of these cancers, it does not mean you will gain weight. And you may gain weight if you have a different type of cancer. If you gain weight during your cancer treatment, let your doctor know so they can assess the cause and type of weight gain. Small weight fluctuations during cancer treatment are normal and expected. But if weight gain is sudden, such as 5 pounds in a week, or does not stop, tell your doctor right away. Causes of weight gain in people with cancer Fluid retention. Some cancers may cause weight gain due to the size of the tumor or the buildup of fluid. There are different types of fluid buildup, but they all can cause you to gain weight. Learn more at Edema (Swelling) and Cancer Treatment . Increased appetite. Increased appetite and food cravings that result in weight gain may occur from the cancer itself, cancer treatment, or medicines used with cancer treatment. Metabolic changes. Hormone therapy may cause weight gain by lowering sex hormones. When you have lower levels of sex hormones, your metabolism slows. Our metabolism is the rate at which we burn energy. A slower metabolism means you burn less energy, which makes it easier to gain weight. Some hormone therapies and chemotherapy may lead to early menopause in women. Early menopause may decrease your metabolism and cause weight gain. Medications. Steroids , which are often given during cancer treatment, increase appetite and make you want to eat more. When we eat more calories than our body burns, we gain weight. If you take steroids, try to eat foods high in fiber and protein at each meal to help you stay full. Steroids may also cause weight gain by causing your body to hold onto water (fluid retention). If you retain water, you may look and feel swollen. Learn more about fluid retention at Edema (Swelling) and Cancer Treatment . Decreased activity. Many cancer treatments can cause fatigue and pain, making it hard to be active. Being less active may in turn lead to weight gain. Talk to your doctor about how to manage problems like fatigue or pain to stay as active as possible. Learn more at Cancer Fatigue and Pain and Cancer . Ways to manage increased appetite and weight gain in people with cancer Here are some tips to manage increased appetite and slow or stop weight gain. Talk with your doctor or dietitian about these tips and which ones are right for you. Tips about foods to eat: To help with weight changes, keep the pantry and refrigerator stocked with healthy snacks, such as overnight oats. Credit: iStock Eat foods high in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads, cereals, and pasta. Eat fish, lean meats, such as lean beef, pork trimmed of fat, and poultry (chicken or turkey) without skin. Eat plant-based proteins, such as beans, nuts, seeds, and tofu. Eat low-fat dairy products, such as 1% and skim. Eat foods that you enjoy so you feel satisfied. Tips about foods to limit: Eat less fat. Cook with and use less salt to reduce fluid retention. Reduce sugary drinks like fruit juices and soda. Try diluting fruit juice with water. Limit or do not drink alcohol. Grocery shopping tips: Buy ground meat that is 93% lean or higher. Buy leaner cuts of meat, such as “loin,” “sirloin,” or “round.” To help control portions, buy food in single-serving containers, such as single-serve yogurts. Meal prep tips: Limit cooking oils. As a general guideline, use 1 teaspoon if cooking for yourself. Use 1 to 2 tablespoons if cooking for more than just yourself. Use cooking methods that reduce fat, like baking, broiling, air frying, roasting, and boiling. Other ways to help with weight gain: Plan meals and snacks ahead of time. Keep your pantry and refrigerator stocked with healthy snacks. Eat only when hungry. Find activities you enjoy, if you eat out of boredom. Eat more slowly. It takes about 15 minutes for the stomach and brain to know if you are full. Slowing down when you are eating can help you know if you are full or not. Eat smaller amounts of food at meals. Use smaller plates. Exercise daily. Keep a food diary. This can help you see what foods and drinks you eat that help you to manage your weight. If you have swelling from steroids, try limiting or avoiding foods that are high in sodium , such as: breads that have a long shelf life sauces dressings cheese deli and canned meats olives certain frozen foods, such as pizza and frozen dinners canned foods (look for low-sodium options) table salt seasonings with salt If you don’t want to cut out these foods, look for lower sodium options. You can look at the front of a product to see if it says, “low sodium,” “very low sodium,” or “sodium free.” Instead of using the saltshaker, use dried or fresh spices like garlic and onion powder or fresh basil and oregano. Talk with your doctor and dietitian before going on a diet to lose weight. If you eat because of stress, fear, or depression, think about talking with a counselor. Your doctor might also prescribe medicine to help with these feelings. Learn more about Emotions and Cancer . Malnutrition and cancer Malnutrition is when your body doesn’t get enough energy, protein, vitamins , and minerals . Causes of malnutrition in cancer Malnutrition can be caused by the cancer itself, the side effects of cancer treatment, or both. Cancer and its treatment can cause malnutrition in many ways. They can decrease your appetite, make you feel full quickly, and change your sense of taste and smell. These changes may cause you to eat less. In fact, decreased appetite or appetite loss is a main cause of malnutrition in people with cancer. Cancer may also lead to malnutrition by causing problems with swallowing, digestion, and absorption of your food. Common treatment side effects that increase the risk of malnutrition are: appetite loss dry mouth mouth sores feeling full quickly taste changes problems swallowing Cancer and cancer treatments may also cause fatigue , pain , anxiety, distress, and depression , all of which can make eating a challenge, both physically and emotionally. Talk to your doctor and registered dietitian about any of your side effects and concerns. Your team is there to support you and help you manage these challenges. Problems caused by malnutrition Malnutrition can cause you to be weak, tired, and not able to fight infection or even finish cancer treatment. Studies show that malnutrition can decrease your quality of life and become life-threatening. Screening for malnutrition Your health care team may use nutrition screenings and assessments to catch eating problems early and measure your risk of malnutrition. Ask your doctor about a nutrition screening before treatment starts and when you should be screened again during treatment. Ways to prevent malnutrition Here are tips to prevent malnutrition. Tips on what to eat: Eat foods high in calories and protein . Use nutrition supplement drinks, such as Ensure or Boost. Tips on when to eat: Eat small meals spaced throughout the day. Aim for five to six small meals each day. Eat every 2 to 3 hours. Tips on talking with your doctor or dietitian: Report loss of appetite and other eating problems to your doctor right away. Ask your doctor about a referral to a registered dietitian. A registered dietitian can do a nutrition assessment and provide a nutrition care plan. Ask your dietitian about high-calorie and high-protein nutrition supplement drinks. Report weight loss of more than 3 to 5 pounds in one week to your doctor. If you continue to have trouble eating and are losing weight, your doctor or dietitian might suggest tube feeding (enteral nutrition) or IV nutrition (parenteral nutrition). Learn more about tube feeding and IV nutrition at Nutrition During Cancer Treatment . Getting support for weight changes and malnutrition Support from family and friends. Ask your family and friends to help with meal planning, grocery shopping, cooking, and cleaning. Provide them with a list of your favorite foods and meals they can prepare for you. Support from your health care providers. If you’re having trouble with eating and drinking, your doctor and dietitian can help. Your doctor can help you find medicines to manage certain problems and refer you to a registered dietitian. Your registered dietitian is your nutrition expert. They can help you with eating and drinking habits before, during, and after treatment. Support for caregivers. Do not be surprised or upset if your loved one’s food preferences change from day to day. There may be days when they do not want a favorite food or say it now tastes bad. Offer gentle support rather than pushing your loved one to eat. Talk with your loved one about ways to manage eating problems. Ask the doctor for a referral to a dietitian and meet with them together. Talk through problems and seek other advice that can help you both feel more in control.

    "content": "How to Gain Weight After Cancer Treatment | Dana-Farber Cancer Institute Skip to main content Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most important things you can do to help reduce your chance of developing cancer and help promote cancer survivorship. However, some people find that they lose weight as a result of their particular cancer or treatments and are concerned about how to gain back weight after treatment. When going through cancer treatment, it's common to experience a loss of appetite, taste changes, or other symptoms that make it difficult or less desirable to eat. At the same time, your metabolism may be more \"revved up\" and your body may require more calories than normal to maintain your weight. It's easy to see why you may be losing weight when you want to eat less, but your body requires more. Steps You Can Take There are steps you can take, however, to prevent excess weight loss and promote healthy weight gain during and after cancer treatment: Try to eat small, frequent meals and snacks throughout the day. Use smaller plates and cups as typical-sized portions often seem overwhelming. Try adding calorie-dense, nutritious foods such as nut butters and avocados to your diet. Smoothies and soups are good sources of necessary liquids and lots of nutrients. In addition to more calories, your body needs more nutrients and more protein. Protein is very important for the immune system, to fight fatigue, and to help maintain muscle mass. Ask someone to help with food shopping and preparation to conserve your energy for eating. Ask a family member or friend to pack a small cooler with quick and easy meals or nutritious snacks and fluids that you can keep with you while you are sitting and resting, or take with you on the go. When going through cancer treatment, it's common to experience a loss of appetite, taste changes, or other symptoms that make it difficult or less desirable to eat. Some people find that they lose weight as a result of their particular cancer or treatments and are concerned about how to gain it back. Dana-Farber nutritionist Stacy Kennedy describes steps you can take to prevent excess weight loss and promote healthy weight gain during and after cancer treatment. If you are concerned about unwanted weight loss during cancer treatment smoothies are a great way to pack in extra vitamins, minerals, fluid, fiber, protein and calories. They are also soothing if you are experiencing mouth sores. You can use fresh or frozen fruits and berries and a variety of liquid bases (almond milk, coconut water) to boost nutrients and add flavor. Watch Dana-Farber nutrition specialist Stacy Kennedy demonstrate how to make a fresh smoothie.

    "content": "Cancer and weight: Be a Healthy Weight - American Institute for Cancer Research Overview & Top Tips What the Science Says Maintaining a healthy weight is one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself from cancer. Recent studies have found that up to 41.9% of US adults have obesity – making weight management a crucial factor in reducing the populations risk of cancer. Excess weight and cancer risk When you have overweight or obesity, you increase your risk for a number of health conditions, including heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. You also increase your risk for cancer. Even though awareness is relatively limited on the link between excess weight and cancer risk, the fact is, aside from not smoking, staying at a healthy weight throughout life is the single most important thing you can do to protect yourself from cancer. Maintaining a Healthy Weight to Reduce Cancer Risk What is a Healthy Weight for me? A healthy weight varies from person to person, depending on many factors such as height, age and gender. You can use our AICR BMI calculator to discover more about your ideal healthy weight. How to lose weight and eat healthy on a budget If you are looking for some creative inspiration to enhance your daily meals with healthier alternatives, we have caringly curated an exciting recipes section which combines these ingredients into delicious, well-balanced meals that will help you in your journey to achieve a healthy diet and weight. Manage Weight With Food There’s a lot of misinformation out there about diets and food, and sometimes it can be pretty hard to separate opinion from fact. Our resources can help you sort out what’s what. The New American Plate This scientifically sound nutritional model can help you make meal planning simple, nutritious, and delicious. The New American plate helps you to manage your weight by suggesting that at least 2/3 of your plate should include vegetables, fruits, whole grains or beans, whilst only 1/3 (or less) should be animal protein. Understanding food values to manage weight Our AICR Food Facts page breaks down the science behind different cancer fighting foods, which can help you to choose healthy, budget-friendly cooking ingredients. Visit our detailed food facts library to see your favorite food’s nutritional value, cancer fighting potential and start getting ideas about dishes and recipes. The Third Expert Report shows a strong link between excess body fat and cancer risk There is convincing evidence that too much excess weight from body fat can increase cancer risk. Research suggests that fat at the waist or visceral fat is also a problem. Impact of excess weight and obesity on cancer risk Here’s how having too much body fat can put you at risk for cancer: Carrying too much body fat can produce proteins called cytokines which trigger inflammation and/or chronic inflammation. Cancer happens when cellular growth becomes corrupted. A state of constant cellular growth with chronic inflammation creates more opportunities for such corruptions and cancer to occur. Having a large amount of fat tissue can cause your body to produce too much estrogen, which can lead to the development of several cancers, including breast cancer and endometrial cancer. Fat cells produce a variety of proteins that cause high levels of insulin and other hormones, which in turn may spur cancer cell growth. Risk for cancer increases with having excess visceral fat and significant excess body fat. Take Action to Manage your Weight Now is always the best time to take action and make some lifestyle changes to achieve a healthy weight. There may be some challenges along your journey, and it may take some time, but if you’re ready to improve your weight, it is possible. How to Maintain a Healthy Weight Eat Nutritious Foods An important piece of weight management is your nourishment. Eat more vegetables, fruits, whole grains and beans complemented with protein-rich foods. Dining on meals comprised primarily of whole and minimally processed foods with tweaked portions will have an immediate impact on your waistline and health. Avoid Sugary Drinks and Alcoholic Beverages Sugary drinks and alcohol don’t offer nutritional benefits. In fact, these unnecessary, unhelpful calories will only help you pack on the pounds. Instead of drinking a soda, reach for water, unsweetened tea or coffee. Not only will you avoid gaining weight from the concentrated calories in sugar-sweetened beverages, you can also reduce your cancer risk directly by avoiding alcoholic beverages. Mind Your Portions and Proportions Try dishing up smaller servings of food and using smaller plates and bowls when you eat. Also, try to eat only when you’re hungry and stop when you feel full. Eating slowly can help with this, as it gives you a chance to savor your food and know when your body is satisfied. Being mindful of portions and filling two-thirds of your plate with delicious plant foods can help you to manage and maintain a healthy weight. You can learn more about portions and proportions by exploring the New American Plate nutritional model. By being more aware of how much you are eating, and the proportions of different types of food on your plate, you will have a much easier time managing your weight. Be Physically Active To prevent weight gain that raises your risk of cancer, AICR recommends you be moderately active at least two and a half hours a week. Being moderately active can include going for a brisk walk, cycling, even gardening — any activity that increases your heart rate and leaves you slightly out of breath. The more you move, the greater the benefit — so upping your activity is even more cancer protective. To intentionally lose weight, start with moderate activities and work up to more vigorous activities — go for a run, play sports, or go to the gym. Whatever activities you do, do those you enjoy. Move More and Sit Less Being inactive and sitting too much — whether it is at a desk or in front of a TV can lead to weight gain. You should build regular movement breaks into your daily routine to encourage yourself to move around more. Try taking breaks for 10 to 15 minutes to get up, move around or stretch for a little while to give your body a break from the day-to-day stresses of being sedentary. By keeping your body more active, it will help you to keep excess weight off. Keep It Up One of the hardest aspects of losing weight is accepting that it takes time. Changing your habits and diet can be challenging. Know that feelings of frustration are normal. Consider transitioning to a more nutritious eating style and more active lifestyle slowly, so you don’t get tempted to give up. Before long, a plant-based diet and a more active lifestyle will become your new norm, and you will be well on your way to attaining a healthy weight to help reduce cancer risk.

    "content": "Mind-Body Therapies: Introduction - CancerChoices Mind-Body Therapies: Introduction Mind-body therapies help your mind influence your body’s function and symptoms. Some methods focus on calming your thoughts, improving focus, enhancing decision-making capacity, managing stress, or resolving conflict. Others aim to relax both your mind and your body. Spiritual practices and consciousness-changing (psychedelic) therapies are part of this group, as well as practices such as meditation, psychotherapy, and mindful movement therapies such as yoga or qigong. Mind-body interventions are often used in combination, such as guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation with breathing techniques. Many mind-body therapies are linked to lower levels of symptoms and side effects common in cancer, such as pain, fatigue, stress, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, depression, and sleep disruption. Many people with cancer engage in mind-body therapies to support well-being and quality of life. Managing Symptoms and Side Effects › Some mind-body therapies may help optimize your body terrain the internal conditions of your body, including nutritional status, fitness, blood sugar balance, hormone balance, inflammation and more , creating an environment within your body less supportive of cancer development, growth, or spread. Optimizing Your Body Terrain › While most mind-body approaches are inherently health-promoting, we encourage you to consult your healthcare team before starting a therapy. Some therapies may not be appropriate for your situation, and many are more effective with professional instruction, guidance, and supervision. You may also ask your physician for a referral to a class or practitioner for many mind-body approaches. Therapies This mind-body therapy uses your imagination to help you relax, relieve symptoms, stimulate your body’s healing responses, access inner strengths and resources, and tolerate procedures and treatments better. Therapies Meditation means using attention and awareness to self-regulate. Meditation may improve emotional well-being, reduce stress and fatigue, and improve sleep for people with cancer. Therapies Psilocybin, produced by many species of mushrooms, is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound which has shown substantial effects for managing anxiety and depression among people with cancer. Therapies Relaxation techniques may promote better quality of life and reduce or relieve several common side effects. Therapies Support groups and interventions may help manage distress and side effects of cancer treatments. Therapies Tai chi and qigong are forms of mind-body exercise and meditation that may help with symptoms of cancer and side effects of treatments. Therapies Yoga may manage symptoms and side effects and body terrain imbalances common in cancer.

    "content": "How to Use an N95 Mask skip to main content You are Here: Home Page > Preparing For and Weathering Floods, Storms and Power Outages > How to Use an N95 Mask How to Use an N95 Mask How to Use an N95 Mask is available in PDF. This webpage provides advice for using a disposable N95 mask.. A disposable N95 mask (respirator) is a safety device that covers the nose and mouth and helps protect the wearer from breathing in some hazardous substances. An N95 mask protects you from breathing in small particles in the air such as dust and mold. It is designed to filter out at least 95% of the dust and mold in the air. What to Get You should only use an N95 mask that is certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Look for the NIOSH logo and the test and certification (TC) approval number on the mask or packaging. Masks that are not certified by NIOSH may not provide adequate protection to you. Masks are typically available from your local hardware stores or home improvement centers. Use an N95 mask even if you cannot see the particles because they may be too small to see. N95 masks do NOT protect you against chemical vapors, gases, carbon monoxide, gasoline, asbestos, lead or low oxygen environments. Who Should Check with a Healthcare Provider First If you have a pre-existing medical condition, wearing a mask may make breathing more difficult because you must pull air through the mask as you inhale. People with known or suspected breathing problems, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or cardio/pulmonary problems should consult with their physician before using one. If at any time during use of the mask you experience headache, nausea, dizziness or have difficulty breathing, immediately leave the area, remove the mask, get fresh air, and seek medical attention if needed. How to Wear the N95 Mask Always read and follow the manufacturer's directions when using an N95 mask. It must cover both the nose and mouth to keep you from breathing in mold and dust. If it does not have a snug fit, it will not work properly. Correct fit of the mask requires contact with smooth skin. It will not work properly for people with beards or facial hair. Even one-day beard growth has been shown to let air leak in. Always use both straps on the mask to hold it in place to keep air from leaking around it. How to Make Sure the Mask Fits Do a user seal check, including both positive and negative pressure checks, to verify that you have correctly put on the mask and adjusted it to fit properly. Negative pressure check Place both hands completely over the mask and inhale sharply. Be careful not to disturb the position of the mask. The mask should pull into your face. If air leaks around your face or eyes, adjust the nosepiece and straps and repeat the positive pressure check. Positive pressure check Put your hands over the mask and breathe out sharply. If your mask has an exhalation valve (like the one pictured above) be sure to cover the exhalation valve when you exhale. No air should leak out of the mask if it fits properly. If air leaks out, re-adjust the nosepiece and straps and repeat the negative pressure check. When to Throw Out the N95 Mask As the N95 mask gets clogged, it becomes more difficult to breathe. When this occurs, throw it out and use a new one. Discard the mask if it is wet or dirty on the inside, if it is deformed, or if the filter is torn. A deformed mask may not fit properly. An N95 mask cannot be cleaned or disinfected. Additional Information For additional information on N95 masks or other types of masks, you can contact the Bureau of Occupational Health and Injury Prevention at (518) 402-7900 or (800) 458-1158. Also note: if masks are required for your job, your employer must implement a respiratory protection program that meets Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) or Public Employee Safety and Health (PESH) standards.

    "content": "What is BPA? Should I be worried about it? - Mayo Clinic This content does not have an English version. This content does not have an Arabic version. Skip to content Appointments at Mayo Clinic Mayo Clinic offers appointments in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota and at Mayo Clinic Health System locations. Request Appointment Products and services What is BPA, and what are the concerns about BPA? BPA stands for bisphenol A, an industrial chemical that has been used to make certain plastics and resins since the 1950s. BPA is found in polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins. Polycarbonate plastics are often used in containers that store food and beverages, such as water bottles. They may also be used in other consumer goods. Epoxy resins are used to coat the inside of metal products, such as food cans, bottle tops and water supply lines. Some dental sealants and composites also may contain BPA . Some research has shown that BPA can seep into food or beverages from containers that are made with BPA . Exposure to BPA is a concern because of the possible health effects on the brain and prostate gland of fetuses, infants and children. It can also affect children's behavior. Additional research suggests a possible link between BPA and increased blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has said that BPA is safe at the very low levels that occur in some foods. This assessment is based on the review of hundreds of studies. The FDA continues to monitor the research. If you're concerned about BPA , you can take steps to reduce your exposure: Use BPA -free products. Manufacturers are creating more and more BPA -free products. Look for products labeled as BPA -free. If a product isn't labeled, keep in mind that some, but not all, plastics marked with recycle code 3 or 7 may contain BPA . Avoid heat. Don't put plastic containers in the microwave or dishwasher, because the heat may break them down over time and allow BPA to leach into foods. Focus on fresh whole foods.

    "content": "Enjoy a healthy, clean eating, gluten-free, and vegan breakfast or dessert with this Easy Chia Seed Pudding! Made with antioxidant rich berries and slightly adapted from a Dr. Mark Hyman recipe. This healthy superfood and plant based recipe for an easy chia seed pudding is a fantastic way to start the day. Perfect for when you need a paleo breakfast recipe or are lacking in Keto breakfast ideas. This mixed berry chia seed pudding is so simple to make, but it does take some planning (12 hours in advance). The night before, puree together your favorite mixed berries and coconut milk in a large bowl. Stir in the chia seeds, vanilla, cinnamon, and salt. Tightly cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. When you wake up, breakfast will be ready! Chia seeds are tiny seeds from the salvia hispanica plant (a member of the mint family), dating back to the Pre-Columbian era and were a main food in the Mayan diet. They are filled with all sorts of vital nutrients, like fiber, protein, antioxidants, calcium, and plant-based omega-3 essential fatty acids. When combined with a liquid, chia seeds develop a gelatinous texture which makes them easier to digest. Their thick consistency makes them perfect for all kinds of puddings. This pudding is slightly adapted from the Blueberry Chia Seed Breakfast Pudding recipe from the 10-Day Detox Diet book of Dr. Mark Hyman. Dr. Hyman's version of a chia seed pudding is a little more dense in texture, as opposed to a creamier one. Whenever I want a creamier pudding, I just add an additional ¼ cup of coconut milk to the recipe. Recipe Ingredients: 2 cups of organic mixed berries divided, ¾ cup full fat coconut milk (for a creamier texture add an additional ¼ cup of coconut milk), ½ cup chia seeds, ½ teaspoon real vanilla extract, ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon sea salt, ½ cup shredded unsweetened coconut, 2 tablespoons hemp seeds, ¼ cup toasted pumpkin seeds or your favorite nut chopped. Instructions: Using a stand up or hand blender, blend together 1 cup of the berries and the coconut milk until smooth. In a medium bowl, add the chia seeds, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and salt. Pour in the berry coconut mixture and stir until thoroughly combined. Tightly cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 12 hours to overnight. When ready to eat, divide into 4 bowls and top with coconut, hemp seeds, seeds or nuts, and remaining 1 cup of berries. Recipe Notes: For a creamier texture add an additional ¼ cup of coconut milk. Store leftovers in refrigerator for up to 5 days.",

    "title": "How Does Nature Impact Our Wellbeing? | Taking Charge of Your Wellbeing",
    "url": "https://www.takingcharge.csh.umn.edu/enhance-your-wellbeing/environment/nature-and-us/how-does-nature-impact-our-wellbeing",
    "content": "Research reveals that environments can increase or reduce our stress, which in turn impacts our bodies. What you are seeing, hearing, experiencing at any moment is changing not only your mood, but how your nervous, endocrine, and immune systems are working. The stress of an unpleasant environment can cause you to feel anxious, or sad, or helpless. This in turn elevates your blood pressure, heart rate, and muscle tension and suppresses your immune system. A pleasing environment reverses that. And regardless of age or culture, humans find nature pleasing. In one study cited in the book Healing Gardens, researchers found that more than two-thirds of people choose a natural setting to retreat to when stressed. Nature heals: Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical wellbeing, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones. It may even reduce mortality, according to scientists such as public health researchers Stamatakis and Mitchell. Research done in hospitals, offices, and schools has found that even a simple plant in a room can have a significant impact on stress and anxiety. Nature soothes: In addition, nature helps us cope with pain. Because we are genetically programmed to find trees, plants, water, and other nature elements engrossing, we are absorbed by nature scenes and distracted from our pain and discomfort. This is nicely demonstrated in a now classic study of patients who underwent gallbladder surgery; half had a view of trees and half had a view of a wall. According to the physician who conducted the study, Robert Ulrich, the patients with the view of trees tolerated pain better, appeared to nurses to have fewer negative effects, and spent less time in a hospital. More recent studies have shown similar results with scenes from nature and plants in hospital rooms. Nature restores: One of the most intriguing areas of current research is the impact of nature on general wellbeing. In one study in Mind, 95% of those interviewed said their mood improved after spending time outside, changing from depressed, stressed, and anxious to more calm and balanced. Other studies by Ulrich, Kim, and Cervinka show that time in nature or scenes of nature are associated with a positive mood, and psychological wellbeing, meaningfulness, and vitality. Furthermore, time in nature or viewing nature scenes increases our ability to pay attention. Because humans find nature inherently interesting, we can naturally focus on what we are experiencing out in nature. This also provides a respite for our overactive minds, refreshing us for new tasks. In another interesting area, Andrea Taylor's research on children with ADHD shows that time spent in nature increases their attention span later. Nature connects: According to a series of field studies conducted by Kuo and Coley at the Human-Environment Research Lab, time spent in nature connects us to each other and the larger world. Another study at the University of Illinois suggests that residents in Chicago public housing who had trees and green space around their building reported knowing more people, having stronger feelings of unity with neighbors, being more concerned with helping and supporting each other, and having stronger feelings of belonging than tenants in buildings without trees. In addition to this greater sense of community, they had a reduced risk of street crime, lower levels of violence and aggression between domestic partners, and a better capacity to cope with life's demands, especially the stresses of living in poverty. This experience of connection may be explained by studies that used fMRI to measure brain activity. When participants viewed nature scenes, the parts of the brain associated with empathy and love lit up, but when they viewed urban scenes, the parts of the brain associated with fear and anxiety were activated. It appears as though nature inspires feelings that connect us to each other and our environment. Too much time in front of screens is deadly: Nature deprivation, a lack of time in the natural world, largely due to hours spent in front of TV or computer screens, has been associated, unsurprisingly, with depression. More unexpected are studies by Weinstein and others that associate screen time with loss of empathy and lack of altruism. And the risks are even higher than depression and isolation. In a 2011 study published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, time in front of a screen was associated with a higher risk of death, and that was independent of physical activity. The Mayo Clinic recommends limiting children's exposure to screens including computers, television, hand-held devices, and video games to two hours per day. More than that can have serious consequences, including obesity, behavioral problems, irregular sleep, violent tendencies, poor academic performance, and dampened creativity. Instead, encourage your child to engage with nature, whether that's playing an outdoor sport, reading next to a window, or taking a walk around the block.",

    "content": "The idea that spending time in nature can make you feel better is intuitive. We all feel this to be true, and many of us have anecdotes of our own or from friends or family that support that idea. People who have been suffering from stress, sickness, or a trauma can spend quiet contemplative time in gardens or taken to the mountains or woods to heal. But nature is not just wilderness. The benefits of nature can also be found in our communities' parks and green spaces. Researchers are amassing a body of evidence, proving what we all know to be true: nature is good for us and has both long and short term mental and physical health benefits. This guide provides hundreds of free research studies, news articles, and case studies, organized by adult and children health topics.
