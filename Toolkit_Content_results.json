Most people can appreciate the beauty of nature, but did you know that being in natural can also enhance your mental and physical health? The research paints a clear picture about the healing power of nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s start with the brain. Many studies have shown that being in or around green space helps with cognitive development in children and is also correlated with higher attentional functioning and cognitive performance in adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a 2021 review, in addition to brain function, studies confirm that there is an association between nature exposure and improved blood pressure, physical functioning, stress reduction, and sleep. Research is also clear that spending time in nature helps enhance emotional wellbeing and mental health. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, being physically active outdoors will give you even more health benefits. In the scientific literature, this is known as green exercise, and it has been shown to enhance the mental and physical benefits of exercise compared to being active indoors. A 2022 review of 19 different studies showed that green exercisers had less anxiety, tension, anger, and depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s more, even if you can’t actually get out and spend time in nature, research shows that you can get similar results with virtual nature exposure by viewing nature on your computer, TV, or looking at nature photos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Henry Thoreau wrote in Walden, “we can never have enough nature.” As it turns out, when it comes to mental and physical health he was right. Try to get out and enjoy nature as much as possible. And if you can, be physically active outdoors as much as possible. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"LiH2022\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Li H 2022\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"33946197\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Jimenez, 2021\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"Kajosaari21\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Kajosaari A, 2021\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"SchertzKE2019\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Schertz KE, 2019\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"BratmanGN2019\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Bratman GN 2019\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"30510422\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"White, 2018\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123136", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00182","name":"Adaptogens","create_date":"2025-03-12","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Adaptogens</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Adaptogens are natural substances such as plant extracts and mushrooms that help the body maintain balance and general wellness. They are most known to help with stress management, anxiety, and energy levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we often can’t control the amount of stress we are under, we can help the body better manage that stress to reduce any potential stress-related negative health consequences. For thousands of years adaptogen plants have been used to improve adaptability and resilience regardless of the nature or degree of the stressor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Popular and well-studied adaptogens include Panax ginseng, Rhodiola rosea, and Ashwagandha. Some adaptogenic mushrooms include Reishi, Cordyceps, Turkey tail, and others. Research shows that these adaptogens decrease cortisol levels, the potent stress hormone, and reduce subjective stress levels in mentally stressed-out healthy adults. Adaptogens also help ease both mental and physical fatigue. Specific to cancer survivors, research shows that several adaptogenic herbs can help with cancer-related fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adaptogens are available as dietary supplements, and they can include just one or a combination of adaptogen ingredients. If you are going through active cancer treatment, it’s important to work with an integrative or naturopathic physician who is well-versed at using adaptogens in their clinical practice. Not all physicians understand dosage and applications for the variety of adaptogens available.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"Meszaros2023\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Meszaros, 2023\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"BoolaniA2022\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Boolani A, 2022\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"34123477\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Lemke, 2021\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"Alschuler2014\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Alschuler, 2014\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123131", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00183","name":"Probiotics and Prebiotics","create_date":"2025-03-12","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Probiotics and Prebiotics</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It may sound creepy, but the human body contains trillions of microorganisms that significantly outnumber human cells. These bacterial organisms are found both inside and outside the body with the lion’s share of them taking up residence in the gut. And there are both good and bad bacteria to contend with. When the bad bacteria outnumber the good, health problems can occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probiotics are good bacteria that enhance health, and prebiotics are the food that keeps the probiotics healthy and strong. Probiotics help support health on many levels including enhanced immunity and even brain function and mental health because the gut microbiome is bidirectionally connected to the brain. Research shows that probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium can enhance mental health and decrease risk of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>By enhancing the health of the gut microbiome, probiotics and prebiotics strengthen immunity, are anti-inflammatory, and support the health of many body functions such as cardiovascular, blood sugar, and more. Probiotics and prebiotics have also been shown to reduce risk of several cancers including colon, breast, cervical, and bladder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many foods that contain probiotics including yogurt, sauerkraut, kombucha, kimchi, miso, and tempeh. Some prebiotic foods are leeks, onions, garlic, oats, apples, and cabbage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probiotics and prebiotics are also available as dietary supplements. It can be difficult getting the appropriate therapeutic dose of probiotics and prebiotics through diet alone so that’s when taking a dietary supplement may make sense. Because choosing an effective probiotic/prebiotic supplement can be challenging, consider working with an integrative or naturopathic physician with expertise in this area.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"SenderR2016\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Sender R, 2016\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"YouS2022\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"You S, 2022\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"Verma2024\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Verma, 2024\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"AlHabsi2024\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Al-Habsi 2024\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"33374549\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Śliżewska, 2020\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"Salmeán2024\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Salmeán, 2024\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123142", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00157","name":"CanHEAL Search Results","create_date":"2023-08-08","publish_date":"2023-08-09","related_docs":{},"categories":[],"content_json":{"body": "<link href=\"/css/solrSearch.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"/>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t<h2>Search Results</h2>\r\n\t<p><a href=\"search.html\" class=\"button is-link\">\r\n\t\t<span class=\"icon\">\r\n\t\t\t<i class=\"fas fa-search\"></i>\r\n\t\t</span>\r\n\t\t<span>Start a new search</span>\r\n\t</a></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<div id=\"app\">\r\n\t<async url=\"%%CONTEXT_PATH%%/solr/query?mainSearch=true\" public=\"true\">\r\n\t\t<template v-slot:default=\"{ pending, error, data }\">\r\n\t\t\t<div v-if=\"pending\">Searching ...</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div v-else-if=\"error\">\r\n\t\t\t\tThere was an error loading the page.\r\n\t\t\t\t<h1 v-html=\"writeErrorMessage(error)\"></h1>\r\n\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t<div v-else>\r\n\t\t\t\t<input type=\"hidden\" v-bind:placeholder=\"parseResults(data.results)\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div v-if=\"data.totalResults === 0\">\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<h3>There were no search results.</h3>\r\n\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t<div v-else>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<div style=\"margin: auto;

This type of acupuncture has been found to be effective for the treatment of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, peripheral neuropathy, joint pain related to estrogen-blocking medicine, as well as pain and fatigue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consider acupuncture for:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Chemotherapy-related nausea-vomiting</li>\r\n\t<li>Post-operative nausea and vomiting</li>\r\n\t<li>Joint Pain (related to estrogen-blocking medicine)</li>\r\n\t<li>Pain (Cancer, postoperative)</li>\r\n\t<li>Peripheral neuropathy</li>\r\n\t<li>Fatigue (post-chemo)</li>\r\n\t<li>Anxiety</li>\r\n\t<li>Irregular bowels</li>\r\n\t<li>Hiccups</li>\r\n\t<li>Insomnia</li>\r\n\t<li>Lymphedema</li>\r\n\t<li>Improving vitality</li>\r\n\t<li>Radiation induced dry mouth (xerostomia)</li>\r\n\t<li>Improved chemotherapy side effects</li>\r\n\t<li>Hot flashes</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture helps to balance &ldquo;qi&rdquo; or &ldquo;chi.&rdquo; Qi refers to the energy flow in your body. This energy is sometimes blocked in parts of your body.&nbsp; Western (allopathic) medicine has not been able to determine the nature of how acupuncture works in the body, though there are theories that it may stimulate nerves, muscles, and connective tissue.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safety</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Acupuncture is generally safe. The risks of acupuncture are low if you have a competent, certified acupuncture practitioner using sterile needles. Minor bruising, or rarely minor bleeding, can sometimes happen where the needle is put in. Sometimes the needles can hurt a little bit when they are put in, but most times it does not hurt at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Be cautious using acupuncture if:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You have a bleeding disorder or are on a blood thinner.</li>\r\n\t<li>You have a pacemaker and the practitioner uses acupuncture with electrical pulses.</li>\r\n\t<li>You are pregnant: Some types of acupuncture might stimulate labor.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Find a practitioner</h3>\r\nDifferent types of health professionals can be trained to do acupuncture. Some are medical doctors (MDs), some are licensed acupuncturists, and some are naturopathic physicians or Oriental Medical doctors (OMDs). Talk to your primary health care provider to find someone in your area. If your cancer center does not provide acupuncture, or individual treatments are out of reach financially&mdash;look for community acupuncture and acupuncture schools that offer acupuncture treatments at more affordable rates.\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": null, "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00019","name":"Medicinal Mushrooms","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Super Foods", "Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2>Medicinal Mushrooms</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In Asia, more than 100 species of mushrooms have been used to help treat cancer, infections, and other conditions. Even today, in China and Japan, medicinal mushrooms are routinely used either alone, or in combination with chemotherapy and radiation in cancer treatment. There are many varieties that have been studied and that are marketed for their anti-cancer properties.&nbsp; A few of these varieties include reishi, turkey tail, chaga, maitake, and shitake.&nbsp; These mushrooms have been shown to help activate the immune system, which may explain their cancer-fighting properties.&nbsp; They appear to be non-toxic and generally well-tolerated when taken in supplement form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Doses of medicinal mushrooms vary depending on variety and formulation.&nbsp; Turkey Tail and reishi have been studied in breast and other solid tumor cancer patients and have been shown to be safe and well-tolerated. Medicinal mushrooms can be purchased as individual species, in capsules, tinctures, teas, or in combination formulas as a dietary supplement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some experts avoid the use of medicinal mushrooms with blood or bone marrow cancers such as lymphoma, leukemia or myeloma. This is because of concern of activation of the immune system.&nbsp; More studies are needed to ensure safety in all cancer types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caution is advised in the use of botanicals that are produced abroad as quality control and good manufacturing Practices (GMP) often cannot be assured.&nbsp; Look for GMP on the label or ask your integrative provider for a trusted brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>As Food</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mushrooms tend to be rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants, and many also boost the immune response by increasing natural killer cell activity. Several delicious species, including shiitake, enoki, maitake, oyster, and porcini mushrooms can be found at Asian or other specialty markets in most major cities. If you can’t find fresh mushrooms, dried mushrooms can be rinsed and soaked in hot water to soften and rehydrate before using. Mushroom teas, such as chaga, or blended varieties are now more readily available too. Some mushrooms, such as maitake, are best absorbed with vitamin C so don’t be afraid to include some citrus or peppers with your mushrooms. It’s important to note that it can be difficult to get the full therapeutic value from mushrooms in the diet. Most of the research has utilized medical mushrooms as dietary supplements and not through diet alone.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Jeitler20\" hint=\"Jeitler, 2020\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"36995535\" hint=\"Narayanan, 2023\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"36142412\" hint=\"Park, 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64223", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00072","name":"Relationships","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-02","related_docs":{},"categories":["Emotional Health"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_EMOHEALTH\" cat_name=\"Emotional Health\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Relationships</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A cancer diagnosis impacts those close to you and those you spend the most time with. Those that love you are on your cancer journey too, especially if you have one main support person or caregiver. At times, they may be called on to assist with or make decisions about your care. They may be providing physical, emotional, and spiritual care for you. Family members, loved ones, and caregivers need to process their feelings which may range from grief, to anger, fear, denial, depression, and anxiety. If there are children in the household, the diagnosis can impact their own growth and development needs. Family members and loved ones with previous anxiety, depression, PTSD, or other emotional trauma may need professional counseling or medical help to support their resilience and mental wellbeing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open dialogue and sharing feelings can enhance awareness and understanding between you and your loved ones. Conversations can be challenging but fortunately, many cancer centers offer professional support, including social workers or psychologists that can help everyone involved. Patient, family, or caregiver support groups may also be available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have compassion for family members and/or caregivers as they may be struggling with burnout, feelings of isolation, or feeling like you are a burden. Many caregivers and loved ones want to help, but don't know how. Clear communication can help in meaningful and specific ways. This is not always an intuitive process, and learning to ask for help honestly, but also setting boundaries around personal time in a loving way is important. Cancer is a vulnerable time for everyone involved and can bring out the best and the worst in us. This is normal. Be patient with yourself and your loved ones as these emotions are experienced or processed. For many couples or families, these vulnerable times are opportunities for growth, deepening relationships and loving feelings despite the inherent challenges. Trust in good intentions and be gentle with yourself and each other during these challenging times.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Try This</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Open up to family members and discuss perceived stress or emotional needs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Have a non-judgmental family gathering on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to increase understanding, communication, and gratitude.</li>\r\n\t<li>Enhance your relationships with gratitude rituals or fun activities to relieve stress.</li>\r\n\t<li>Reach out for peer-to-peer support because sometimes it helps to get input and encouragement from others going through what you are.</li>\r\n\t<li>Look for ways to have fun, and remember that you are more than your cancer diagnosis</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Additional Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The following

Remember what matters most in your life. Live by your values.</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<div data-role=\"collapsible\">\r\n\t<h3>Living Your Values</h3>\r\n\t<p>A good life does not mean being happy all the time. It does mean choosing to focus on things that are meaningful and rewarding, and being able to respect yourself for the kind of person you are. What values are most important to you? Integrity? Compassion? Service? Curiosity? Creativity? Teamwork? As you put your finger on the values that are most meaningful for you, can you choose work that lines up with them? Can you spend your free time to line up with those values? Can you treat other people in ways that show those values?</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Think about the values that are most deeply important to you in how you want to be living your life. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>What is deeply important to you? Knowing your cherished values can help you when making tough choices. It can also help you find strength and resilience in hard times. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<blockquote>\r\n\t\t<h4>Values: Journal Activity</h4>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Write down some ideas for the questions below. Then read what you wrote each day for a week or two. Think about how you live these values or qualities day to day. This will help you remember what you care about most when you face tough decisions or challenges.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>What do you take pride in about how you live your life?</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>What are three words or phrases that best describe the kind of person you want to be?</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>What would someone who really loves you say are your best qualities?</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>How would you put into words your personal mission; what you're here to do?</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Think of a time or story about when you have felt most \"alive.\"</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Think of a time or story about when you have been at your best.</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>What is your gift, and how do you offer it? </li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t</blockquote>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"LivingValues\" />\r\n</div>\r\n    \r\n<div data-role=\"collapsible\">\r\n\t<h3>Purpose</h3>\r\n\t<p>Research in Japan and elsewhere suggest that people who have a sense of purpose in life have lower rates of illnesses and live longer than people who do not. Think about the idea of \"purpose\" for you. At the end of your life, what do you want to look back on that will make you feel like you have lived a good life? Caring about other people at home and at work? Passing along life lessons to loved ones? Being an example of determination and sticking with things in hard times? How would you put this into words for yourself?</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"LivingValuesPurpose\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2. Spend time in nature.</strong></h3>\r\n<div data-role=\"collapsible\">\r\n\t<h3>Time in Nature</h3>\r\n\t<p>Reconnecting with nature can decrease anxiety, reduce stress and improve well-being. Research shows that time in nature can also elevate mood, reduce blood pressure, and activate immune function. It doesn’t have to be camping in the woods. Spend some time in whatever nature you can, including  a garden or a park. Reconnecting with nature can inspire awe in the beauty around you. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"TimeNature\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>3.

Spirituality also has to do with \"aliveness\" and what helps us feel passionate and excited about life. What really excites you? When are you so wrapped up in something that you lose track of time – some people refer to this as 'being in flow'. What do you dream about doing when you have the chance? Allowing yourself to be excited and enjoy all sorts of experiences is part of living a good life.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"PassionAliveness\" />\r\n\t</div>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>4. Laugh.</strong> Find humor every day.</h3>\r\n     <div data-role=\"collapsible\">\r\n\t\t<h3>Laughter &amp; Humor</h3>\r\n\t\t <p>Laughter lowers your blood pressure. It also reduces stress hormone levels and strengthens the immune system. Make humor and laughter a part of your life. Laugh with family and friends. Read humorous books, blogs, cartoons. Watch funny movies, stand-up, sitcoms or even videos online. </p>\r\n \r\n <ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"LaughterHumor\" />\r\n\t</div>\r\n \r\n<h3><strong>Practice compassion and trying to know how others feel.</strong> </h3>\r\n     <div data-role=\"collapsible\">\r\n\t\t<h3>Self-compassion</h3>\r\n\t\t <p><strong>Self-compassion</strong> is essential to caring for the spirit. Be as kind to yourself as you would be to someone you dearly love. Then think about what you can learn from your failings and how to live a better life as a result.</p>\r\n \r\n <ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"SelfCompassion\" />\r\n\t</div>\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n<h3><strong>6. Keep a journal of meaningful things you are learning.</strong></h3>\r\n \r\n<h3><strong>7. Take time to pray, meditate or just be still.</strong></h3>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h3><strong>8. Practice kindness and generosity.</strong></h3>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h3><strong>9. Be grateful for good things in your life.</strong></h3>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h3><strong>10. Forgive people who have created hardship for you.</strong></h3>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h3><strong>11. Be gentle with yourself.  Forgive yourself.</strong></h3>\r\n \r\n \r\n<h3><strong>12.

These practices may decrease or prevent depression, reduce stress, build community, as well as bolster resilience and hardiness. There are countless ways to develop a contemplative practice. This is an individual and personal exploration, and there is no right or wrong way to approach contemplation.

Some read sacred books like the Bible, the Torah, or the Koran. Some read inspirational or self-help books. Others might like daily &quot;devotionals,&quot; which are brief stories and meditations.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Consider Trying</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Journaling</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a journal practice for 40 days and 40 nights. Write down anything that you need to remove from the subconscious mind. Decorate your journal with collage, drawings, etc. to engage the senses.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Quiet Reading</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Give yourself at least 15 minutes a day to sit quietly and read. You may choose to read from a sacred text, inspirational book, or humorous novel. Pick whatever calls to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/articles/133731-10-books-to-read-if-youre-battling-cancer\" target=\"_blank\">Bustle: 10 Books To Read If You Are Battling Cancer</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Vision Board</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a vision board from magazine clippings showing your future healed self. This can allow the mind to dwell on this positive imagery. Put the vision board in a place where you can see it and remind yourself of your intentions.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Proprioceptive Writing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A powerful journaling method is called Proprioceptive Writing. This method significantly helps remove blockages that continue to revolve in the mind like a broken record. It allows one to peel back the thought down to the provoking emotions, see the real reasons for the emotion, and come to a creative solution to solve the issue. <a href=\"https://www.healyourlife.com/a-powerful-writing-technique-for-identifying-your-core-beliefs\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more here</a></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Asbury18\" hint=\"Asbury, 2018\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"12377959\" hint=\"Stanton, 2002\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"32719641\" hint=\"Penner, 2020\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"33889534\" hint=\"Garcia-Campayo, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"36294068\" hint=\"Rich, 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65190", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00016","name":"Anti-Inflammatory Diet/Mediterranean Diet","create_date":"2019-03-25","publish_date":"2019-03-25","related_docs":{},"categories":["Diets and Eating Patterns"],"content_json":{"body": "<!--with AI Diet pyramid embed-->\r\n<style>\r\n#mobile {\r\ndisplay: none;\r\n}\r\n.modal_window {\r\nwidth: 85%;\r\n\tposition:absolute; /* important so we can position it on center later */\r\n\tdisplay:none; /* don't show it */\r\n\tz-index:9000001;\r\n\t\r\n\t/* styling */\r\n\tmax-height:560px; overflow:auto;background:#fff;color:#333;border:3px solid #ddd;padding:10px;border-radius: 16px;-moz-border-radius: 16px;-webkit-border-radius: 16px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.close_modal {font-size:xx-small;border:1px solid #1252a3;padding:3px;text-decoration:none;float:right}\r\n.captions { font-style: italic; }\r\n\r\n@media screen and (max-width: 500px) {\r\n  #desktop {\r\ndisplay:none;\r\n  }\r\n#mobile {\r\ndisplay:block;\r\n}\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2>Anti-Inflammatory Diet/Mediterranean Diet</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Chronic inflammation can be damaging to healthy cells and can weaken the immune system. Many chronic diseases, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer&rsquo;s dementia, have been linked to chronic inflammation. Inflammation is a natural process in the body that happens when the body becomes injured. Inflammation also happens when the immune system detects something &lsquo;foreign&rsquo;, like an infectious agent, pollen, or a chemical. Inflammation is intended to protect the body by alerting the immune system to defend against the &lsquo;foreign invader&rsquo;, and to heal and repair damaged tissue. However, when there is chronic inflammation in the body, the repair mechanisms of the body can become disordered and cause damage which is when cancer or another chronic disease can develop. Chronic inflammation can arise for many different reasons, including chronic infection, smoking, toxic exposures, lack of exercise, obesity, poor diet or even stress. Diet is among the best studied approaches to reducing inflammation in the body and therefore reducing the risk of chronic disease. A healthy diet can also be a wonderful way to increase resilience and vitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anti-inflammatory diet is an eating pattern that combines healthy components of traditional Mediterranean and Asian dietary patterns to maximize the healing potential of the foods consumed. Both cultures traditionally offer foods associated with good health and longevity. The foundational aspects of an anti-inflammatory diet is the increase of beneficial anti-inflammatory foods and reduction of harmful pro-inflammatory foods. There is growing evidence that some of the dietary components found in foods, such as fruits, berries, vegetables, nuts, whole grain, herbs, spices, and foods of marine origin&mdash; among others, can be protective against several chronic diseases, including heart disease, arthritis, obesity, depression, and cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best approach to an anti-inflammatory diet is to increase the diversity of fruits, vegetables, and fiber that you eat. Plants in their whole form tend to have nutritional components referred to as &lsquo;phytonutrients&rsquo;, or plant nutrients. These nutrients are concentrated in different amounts in different plant foods. In many cases these health-promoting compounds are what gives the plant food its vibrant color. That's why a healthy diet should include a &lsquo;rainbow&rsquo; of vegetables and fruits&mdash;to increase the amounts and diversity of phytonutrients in your diet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<span id=\"desktop\">\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" borderFragment=\"embed_ency\" docid=\"ECY00084\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n</span>\r\n<span id=\"mobile\">\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" borderFragment=\"embed_ency\" docid=\"ECY00085\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n</span>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourceItems\" title=\"WorldCancer Research Fund  and American Institute for Cancer Research diet recommendations\" link=\"https://www.wcrf.org/diet-and-cancer/cancer-prevention-recommendations/\" first=\"yes\">\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourceItems\" title=\"Anti-Inflammatory Food Pyramid\" link=\"https://www.drweil.com/diet-nutrition/anti-inflammatory-diet-pyramid/dr-weils-anti-inflammatory-food-pyramid/\">\r\n\tDr. Weil&#39;s interactive Anti-Inflammatory Food Pyramid</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourceItems\" title=\"True Food Recipes\" link=\"https://www.drweil.com/diet-nutrition/nutrition/true-food-seasonal-sustainable-simple-pure/\" last=\"yes\">\r\n\tA selection of recipes from the <i>True Food</i> cookbook (scroll toward the end of the page for the recipe links)</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"pahwa2023\" hint=\"Pahwa 2023\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"36039924\" hint=\"Itsiopoulos, 2022\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<script src=\"/js/modal_basic.js\"></script>", "panel": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"subNavPanel\" href=\"/cancertoolkit/nutrition.html\" subname=\"Nutrition\" category=\"CANTK_NUT\"></ecs:dyna>", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65746", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00083","name":"Grieving &amp; Serenity","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Care of the Spirit"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_SPIRIT\" cat_name=\"Care of the Spirit\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Grief &amp; Serenity</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Allowing Yourself to Grieve and Process Feelings to Alleviate Suffering</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Grieving is an important process to release fearful or sad thoughts, a perception of loss, or lack of hope. Grief is something all humans experience at some time in their lives. Unresolved grief can result in tremendous suffering for the individual. There are ways of clearing or processing grief in a healthy and safe manner, fostering resilience, despite the emotional or physical trauma experienced. Grief is not a mental illness, but unresolved grief can lead to severe anxiety and depression, a paralysis or impairment in important decision-making capabilities, or ability to cope with life changes. There is no singular right way to grieve, and it is not something that can be forced. What is important is to provide the emotional space for grief when it arises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"So it's true, when all is said and done, grief is the price we pay for love.\"<br>\r\n-E.A. Bucchianeri</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Cancer support groups, licensed therapists, and mind-body practices such as clinical hypnosis or guided imagery can help in this process. Journaling, dance, or art therapy are creative ways to process these intense emotions. Meditation practices can also help, along with other contemplative and reflective activities. Sharing your feelings of grief can also be helpful. Let your healthcare provider know you are struggling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Serenity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about serenity as putting energy into what you can change and letting go of what you can't. Hard times are often about things beyond our control. In hard times, remember what matters most to you. This can help you focus on meaningful things that are under your control. Some people focus on compassion for self and others. For instance, if it's important to you to speak up for fairness, you can do that. Or, you may feel a desire to 'give back' in some way. Put your energy into what matters most to you and helps you be the kind of person you want to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acceptance can be challenging. Some behaviors you can change, other experiences are out of your control. Emotions and relationships can complicate these challenges. You can't change how another person behaves, and it is hard to change thoughts and feelings that upset you.

ALA is a precursor to omega-3-Fatty acids, a potent natural anti-inflammatory. The lignans in flaxseed are phytoestrogens, which means that they have beneficial hormonal properties. The phytoestrogens of flaxseed have been found to be protective against hormonal cancers such as breast, prostate, and ovarian, as well as a few non-hormonal cancers such as melanoma and lung cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flaxseed has about 3 grams of fiber per tablespoon, as a mixture of soluble and insoluble fiber, so it can stimulate and support healthy bowel movements. Flaxseed is not digestible in whole form, but ground flax meal is available at health food stores. Ground flax is prone to oxidation and can lose its nutritional qualities with time so if you do purchase ground flaxseed, store it in the refrigerator. You can also purchase whole flaxseeds and then grind the seeds in a coffee or spice grinder and store that in a jar in small quantities in the refrigerator. The whole (pre-ground) flaxseed can be stored in a sealed jar in a dark pantry at room temperature until you are ready to grind more.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Try This</h3>\r\n<p>Start with about 1 tablespoon of ground flax meal daily and increase from there depending on how you tolerate it. It can be used in smoothies or shakes or mixed into foods like oatmeal or yogurt. It can also be sprinkled atop salads or soups, as it has a mild nutty flavor. In baking, you can substitute some of the flour in your recipes with flax meal to increase the nutritional content of the baked goods. Keep in mind that flax does not rise and you should not substitute more than 1/3 of flour with flax meal in baking, depending on what your baking goals are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware that when flax meal is mixed with food that is wet (like oatmeal or a smoothie), it should be ingested within 30 minutes. Otherwise, as it sits for long periods, it can thicken and become less palatable.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"37987317\" hint=\"Merkher, 2023\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64225", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00025","name":"Turmeric","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Super Foods", "Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Turmeric</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Turmeric is a spice commonly used in the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia. It is bright yellow in color and comes from the root of the&nbsp;<em>Curcuma longa</em>&nbsp;plant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turmeric has been used for many centuries in Ayurvedic medicine (traditional medicine of India) for a variety of ailments. It is well-studied for its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. In integrative medicine, in addition to cancer prevention and treatment, it is used for joint pain and other inflammatory conditions. Most research has focused around curcumin, which is one of the biologically active constituents of the turmeric root. Even though curcumin has been well-studied and many health benefits well-established, there are other curcuminoids and other components of turmeric that are also medicinal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cancer Research</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several studies that support the anti-cancer properties of turmeric / curcumin, including beneficial effects on colon, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Other studies show that curcumin can improve response to chemotherapy and radiation (called chemo sensitization or radio sensitization).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supplement - Drug Interactions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As a supplement, turmeric is likely safe and well-tolerated, but drug interactions should be considered.&nbsp; Although it is likely safe with most types of chemotherapy, it has the potential to interact with a few of them, including doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Turmeric and curcumin supplements may also interact with blood thinners such as coumadin.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Doses</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many turmeric formulations on the market have been standardized to contain a specific level of curcumin. Some experts believe that the absorption of curcumin can be enhanced by combining it with black pepper (biopiperine), fat, phosphatidylcholine, or gum ghatti among other preparations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dosing for turmeric and standardized curcumin preparations vary widely depending upon the type of preparation. Powdered turmeric root has shown anti-cancer effects at 8g daily. In contrast, many of the concentrated curcumin extracts have shown clinical benefits at dosages between 1g to 3g daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are growing concerns about the interaction of turmeric or curcumin supplements with a variety of chemotherapy drugs, including doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as well as with blood thinners.  For this reason, during the active phase of cancer treatment, it is advisable to discuss turmeric or curcumin supplementation with an integrative medicine provider who is familiar with the chemotherapy or other anti-cancer medications you are receiving to ensure safety and the decrease potential of drug-herb interactions.  Turmeric cooked with food is safe during any phase of cancer treatment and is probably beneficial. Additionally, turmeric or curcumin in large doses can result in gastrointestinal (GI) upset in some people.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" /><ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"alsoInButtons\" />\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"NIHNCI2024\" hint=\"National Cancer Institute 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64229", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00027","name":"Sugar, Carbohydrates, and Cancer","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Foods to Eat Not", "What/what not to eat"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Sugar, Carbohydrates, and Cancer</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Glycemic Index</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Carbohydrates turn into sugar (or glucose) in our bodies, in part due to the enzymes that we secrete that break down carbohydrates into sugar. This is why when we let white bread or a cracker soak for a long time in our mouth; it begins to taste sweet like sugar. Glycemic index is the scientific term used to describe the ranking system of 1 to 100 that is based on the food’s impact on blood sugar levels. The higher the number, the bigger effect that food has on blood sugar levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_GI\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Glycemic Load</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some types of carbohydrates turn into sugar more quickly than others. How fast food turns into sugar, or glucose, is referred to as the glycemic load. Glycemic load also has to do with other properties of the food than simply the amount of carbohydrate, or sugar that it is made up of. Glycemic load considers the amount of fat, protein, and fiber that is in any particular food. This is why apple juice turns more quickly into sugar in the body than eating an apple. The fiber in the apple slows down how fast the sugar from the apple is absorbed in the gut, leading to a slower rise in blood glucose levels. Therefore, apple juice has a higher glycemic load than an apple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this reason, you can’t rely solely on carbohydrate or sugar levels in a particular food to determine how healthy the food is. Of course, the amount of sugar in any food is important, but it is just as important to consider the other components of the food such as the fiber, fat, or protein content.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_GL\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cancer &amp; Sugar Links</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The link between cancer and high sugar foods (or foods with a high glycemic index) is indirect, but meaningful. There are known associations with diets high in carbohydrates and sugars, and the development of prostate, colorectal, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers. A diet high in sugar, especially added sugar, sucrose, and fructose, as well as carbohydrates from fruit juice is associated with a poor prognosis in breast cancer survivors. The opposite is also true as research demonstrates a link between eating fewer carbohydrates and improvements in breast cancer and colon cancer survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Reduce Carbohydrates Wisely</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are trying to cut carbohydrates, do so wisely. Begin with reducing ‘nutrient empty’ foods such as soda, sweets, and foods with added sugar. Replace those foods with complex carbohydrates such as sweet potatoes, quinoa, other whole grains, beans and lentils. These foods have other nutritional benefits and are considered ‘dietary keepers’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Artificial sweeteners are not a good replacement for sugar in the diet for several reasons. Although they don&rsquo;t raise blood sugars directly, they don&rsquo;t support the health of the body either. They disrupt the gut microbiome, which has important implications for the immune system, among other concerns. Additionally, artificial sweeteners have not been shown to aid in weight loss. This is in part because artificial sweeteners are very sweet in their flavor, thereby fooling the brain into thinking that you are eating sugar. When we eat sweet foods, the reward center in our brain is activated, thus leading us to want to eat more sugary or sweet foods, more frequently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best strategy for reducing sugar in your diet, especially if you have a &lsquo;sweet tooth&rsquo;, is to work towards changing your taste and habits. It may take a few weeks, but for most people, once they have minimized sweets and sugar-rich foods, the sweet cravings lessen or stop. This may be because the reward center in the brain stops getting activated and the desire for sugar is reduced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important not to deprive yourself of sugar, as this can lead to sugar binging. Sugar and sweets often symbolize comfort and celebration. They should be considered rare treats to be thoroughly savored, not as a routine or daily part of the diet. If you are craving sweet treats during cancer treatment, you may choose to keep healthier options around such as dark chocolate, unsweetened dried fruits, homemade energy nut/seed balls, or choose to make fruit smoothies with ingredients like banana, nut butters, almond milk and cocoa powder to fulfill the sweet cravings. When you can, choose fruits like berries instead of bananas for their lower sugar content and glycemic load.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedHandoutsList\" /><ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n<p><em>You can also visit the <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/food_as_comfort.html\">Comfort Foods</a> section in this Toolbox for healthier dessert recipes</em>.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"36551528\" hint=\"Epner, 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"38795743\" hint=\"Kanehara, 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34152461\" hint=\"Farvid, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"38288206\" hint=\"Ghusn, 2023\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65504", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00084","name":"Healing Rituals","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Care of the Spirit"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_SPIRIT\" cat_name=\"Care of the Spirit\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Healing Rituals &amp; Ceremony</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Healing rituals offer sacredness to an experience and place through an intentional action for healing or transforming feelings, creating hope, and building resilience. Through healing rituals, the cancer journey can be processed and reframed to create a more desirable experience and better quality of life. This does not have to be in a religious context, though most religions have healing rituals such as prayer, anointment, group meditations, prayer chains/prayer circles, funerals, etc. These rituals create a connectedness to spirit, family, and community to support recovery and healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ceremonies also can provide great comfort, strength, hope and relief from the strain of the cancer journey. Connection to cultural ceremony is also healing, such as Native American sweat lodges, talking stick circles, chanting groups, shamanic ceremonies, and group healings using energy medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating your own personal ritual of daily journaling or art therapy is another example of this healing practice. Does your community have access to a Labyrinth to walk regularly? This can be a contemplative healing ritual. Ritual can also be created around laughter. Humor is very powerful in promoting the healing process with decreases in stress hormones and inflammatory responses. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Try This: Create your own healing ritual</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Pick a time of the day you want to set aside for your own healing. Create a comfortable space that feels sacred and soothing. If you like, add candles, incense, blankets, music, art for inspiration, music for healing or relaxation. The more you appeal to all five senses, the deeper the experience. You may want to begin by centering yourself with a simple breathwork practice of five slow deep breaths. Then journal, meditate, laugh, draw, or pray. Do whatever you are drawn to and find most transforming. Before moving out of this ritual and onto your daily routines give thanks for this time you’ve taken. Repeat your healing ritual daily for best outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If practicing a ritual with a group resonates more with you, look to your spiritual community, support groups, or healing circles.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"17020524\" hint=\"Cueva, 2006\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Loyd17\" hint=\"Loyd, 2017\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<!--p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Hammer97\" hint=\"Hammerschlag, 1997\" /></p-->\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"29897444\" hint=\"Roh, 2018\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Smith18\" hint=\"Smith, 2018\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65197", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00082","name":"Healing Music","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Care of the Spirit"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_SPIRIT\" cat_name=\"Care of the Spirit\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>The Healing Aspects of Sound and Music</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Music is a powerful tool that speaks to our souls and can help release and transform emotions when words are not enough. Music improves symptom management, embodies hope for survival, and helps connect to a pre-illness self. Music can also help to access memories of loss and trauma. Almost everyone listens to music, but focusing on this purposefully, can be a healing modality. Different music arouses different feelings in the listener. Think about how you feel when listening to different genres of music. Feeling the strong emotions sparked by music helps us heal. Why do we choose to experience the emotions roused by music? To help us clear our own?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One study of adult cancer patients compared two sessions of interactive music making with a music therapist to two sessions that involved listening to pre-recorded music of choice without the presence of a therapist. Before and after each session, participants reported on their mood, anxiety, relaxation, and pain. The interactive experience of making music was preferred by most of the participants, but interestingly, the music therapy group and passive listening group both resulted in symptom improvement and enhanced emotional expression. Those working with music making reported tapping into other important inner resources such as playfulness and creativity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Music is used in conjunction with other therapeutic modalities, like massage, guided imagery and energy medicine, to facilitate relaxation and a deeper healing experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sound Healing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound has been used as a healing tool for thousands of years by many ancient civilizations and modern indigenous cultures. Sound healing is founded on the premise that all matter is vibrating at specific frequencies and is based on the principle of entrainment through vibration. Sound healing may be defined as the educated and conscious use of the energy of sound to reach identified goals and promote wellness in the human system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sound affects all systems in the body through a set rhythm and frequency. A wide range of techniques utilize sound as a tool for change. The most basic use of sound is for meditation and relaxation. Chanting, for example, is a powerful method for resonating sound throughout the body. Nature sounds and certain instruments also have specific healing frequencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Try This</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bring music or healing sounds to the hospital or chemo/radiation sessions to decrease anxiety with hospital procedures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use music for relaxation and pain reduction, shifting mood, engaging your creative self, or as an adjunct to meditation, writing, or art therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Music is a wonderful tool for social gatherings and support groups to uplift or facilitate needed grieving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use headphones and your favorite music whenever needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can listen to a 90 second sample of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEXNSf9mPSE\" target=\"_blank\">crystal bowl sound healing by Tryshe Dhevney here</a></p> \r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34637527\" hint=\"Brandt, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"25322972\" hint=\"Brandt, 2015\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"25181938\" hint=\"Zhou, 2015\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65195", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00116","name":"Video: Mindfulness Meditation","create_date":"2019-05-31","publish_date":"2019-05-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Meditation/Mindfulness"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h4>Try This: Meditation Practices</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mindfulness Meditation</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>1 Track; Total Video Length: 4:18</em></p>\r\n<ecs:dyna type=\"Media\" name=\"displayMedia\" assetID=\"633\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": null, "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00115","name":"Video: 4-7-8 Breathing","create_date":"2019-05-31","publish_date":"2019-05-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Meditation/Mindfulness"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t<h4>Video: 4-7-8 Breathing </h4>\r\n<p><em>Length 4:03</em></p>\r\n<ecs:dyna type=\"Media\" name=\"displayMedia\" playlistID=\"244\" loginOptional=\"true\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": null, "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00035","name":"Managing Comfort Food Cravings","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Diets and Eating Patterns"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Managing Comfort Food Cravings</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people gravitate towards comfort foods during cancer treatment. Comfort foods mean something different to each of us, but generally comfort foods can be foods that make us feel warm and nurtured, foods that remind us of our childhood, foods that are easy to prepare, soft foods that are easy to chew or digest, or foods that fulfill a craving such as sweets or salty snacks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even in perfect times, it&rsquo;s hard to maintain a perfectly healthy diet. During cancer treatment, it&rsquo;s normal to crave foods that feel safe and familiar. Many nutritionists advocate for the 80-20 rule. This means, aim to follow a healthy Mediterranean-type anti-inflammatory diet 80% of the time, and eat whatever you crave the other 20%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food is certainly meant to serve us nutritionally, but food symbolizes so much more for us as individuals and culturally. We each have unique relationships with the role of food during hard times. Be gentle with yourself and work towards reducing or eliminating guilt around food. It is normal to crave comfort foods when we are feeling stressed, sleep deprived, sick, or bored. Listen to your body during these times and ask yourself why you may be craving a particular food. For instance, if you are exhausted, food may provide momentary comfort or energy, but ultimately the solution is to find time to rest and restore. If you are stressed or angry, comfort food can feel like a familiar old friend, but the food can&rsquo;t soothe the emotional distress for very long. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several strategies for managing comfort food cravings. One idea might be to bring some snacks and healthy drink options with you during chemotherapy. This way, you can control the quality of your comfort foods instead of eating processed foods that may be readily available at many hospitals or chemotherapy infusion suites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At home, see if you can be creative about how to take healthy ingredients and make warm comforting foods. There are many soup and casserole recipes that have taken traditional home-cooked recipes to create healthier versions of the same foods. Dessert recipes can also be adjusted by adding a few healthier ingredients (like crushed nuts, seeds, or dried fruits), or by reducing the amount of sugar or using some coconut oil to replace the butter. Foods like bananas, peanut butter, dark chocolate, pre-made nut/seed energy &lsquo;balls&rsquo;, sesame crackers, popcorn, and mixed nuts can help replace unhealthier snack cravings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, this is not a time to punish yourself about food.

Most of us are not in control of how our food is grown or processed. The majority of American produce comes from very large, corporate farms where the focus is on productivity and cost-savings, not on maximizing health benefits or environmental consequences of food production. In addition, pesticide use is on the rise worldwide. Over 1 billion pounds of pesticides are used in the United States each year, and 5.6 billion pounds are used worldwide. This amounts to significant daily pesticide and other chemical exposure for the majority of us. It is up to the consumer to navigate shopping choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Environmental Working Group (EWG) is a consumer-funded group whose mission is &ldquo;to empower people to live healthier lives in a healthier environment.&rdquo; Each year, the EWG publishes a guide to help consumers reduce exposure to pesticides and other harmful chemicals. This way, not every item on your grocery list needs to be organic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is eating organic whenever possible so important? Organic farming is better for the environment and organic foods are better for your health because they contain fewer toxins and tend to have higher nutritive value.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_ORGANIC\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Rahman2024\" hint=\"Rahman 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h3>Issues with Affordability</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As awareness has grown about the large-scale use of chemicals in the food industry, there are more smaller, local, organic farms to meet a growing demand for organic food. Farmers markets are popping up in cities everywhere, allowing consumers to buy directly from their local organic farmers, connecting communities to their food in more meaningful ways. Yet not all Americans have access to or are able to afford locally-farmed organic food. At larger grocery stores that sell organic produce, it’s a good idea to read the sales ads. Produce that is on sale is often in season, possibly increasing its freshness and nutritional quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If organic produce is out of reach, be sure to keep eating vegetables and fruits, aiming for 5-9 servings per day. Your body needs the nutrients and the fiber. Use the Clean 15 resource from EWG below to help you select produce and always spend a few minutes washing your produce well. Consider frozen options if access to fresh or organic options are limited. Food assistance can often be used at local farmer's markets which may have organic options.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Wash All Produce</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>All produce, whether purchased organically or not, should be washed well before consuming, unless it has already been &lsquo;pre-washed&rsquo; by the manufacturers (like some pre-packaged greens or salad mixes). Even organically-grown produce has pesticides and fertilizer that are made from organic compounds, so be sure to wash all of your produce well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To remove pesticides/fungicides from the surface of fruits and vegetables:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Mix 1 teaspoon of baking soda per two cups of water</li>\r\n\t<li>Soak produce for 12&ndash;15 minutes, scrub lightly and rinse</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65750", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00030","name":"Healthy Gut","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Foods to Eat", "What/what not to eat"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Healthy Gut</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A healthy gut is essential to overall health. The human gut contains trillions of microorganisms collectively known as the gut microbiome. These microbes play a critical role in the body and are essential to health maintenance. The microbes help support the lining of the intestines, influencing the absorption of foods, nutrients, and even toxic compounds or harmful organisms (pathogens). These microbes also contribute to immune function, blood sugar control, metabolism, inflammation, weight, mood, and even cognition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recent evidence indicates that the health of the gut microbiome may play a role in cancer prevention or development as well. Because of this, it’s important for cancer survivors to prioritize gut health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gut microbiome can be supported in several ways. One of the best ways is through a diet rich in whole food fiber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, foods that are prebiotic and probiotic should be consumed as part of a regular healthy diet. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria and prebiotics are food that feeds those beneficial bacteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Food Sources of Prebiotics and Probiotics</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regularly consuming foods that support diverse microorganisms can be simple (and tasty). Pre- and probiotic foods are becoming more widely available in supermarkets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prebiotics are dietary fiber that support the growth of beneficial bacteria in the colon. Foods containing prebiotics include vegetables in the allium family (onions, garlic, leeks), artichokes, soybeans, asparagus, whole-wheat foods, apple cider vinegar, dandelion greens, and chia seeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probiotics are beneficial live microorganisms that colonize the intestines. They have been linked to several health benefits, including enhanced immunity and gut health. Fermented foods rich in probiotics include sauerkraut, miso, kombucha, kimchi, pickled vegetables, tempeh, and cultured dairy foods (yogurt, aged cheeses, kefir) that contain live cultures such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Akbar2022\" hint=\"Akbar, 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Kumari24\" hint=\"Kumari, 2024\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65749", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00118","name":"Video: Yogic Meditation","create_date":"2019-05-31","publish_date":"2019-05-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Meditation/Mindfulness"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t<p><strong>Yogic Meditation</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>4 Tracks; Total Video Length: 30:11</em></p>\r\n<ecs:dyna type=\"Media\" name=\"displayMedia\" playlistID=\"255\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": null, "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00085","name":"Ayurveda","create_date":"2019-05-21","publish_date":"2019-05-21","related_docs":{},"categories":["Whole Systems"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Ayurveda</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayurveda is one of the oldest medical systems in the world, originating at least five thousand years ago in what is now India. It is a comprehensive system of medicine that emphasizes the interconnectedness of the body, mind, and spirit and strives to maintain the innate harmony of the individual. Ayurvedic medicine utilizes complex herbal combinations along with diet and lifestyle modifications. Many Ayurveda therapies have gained popularity in the United States such as yoga, meditation, massage, and some Ayurvedic herbal medicines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Ayurvedic philosophy, health is not simply the absence of disease, but is rather a state of balance among body, mind, and consciousness. Ayurveda is a philosophy of life as well as a medical system. For example, food is valued for its nutritive and medicinal properties. Many Ayurvedic practitioners focus on dietary interventions for their patients, in addition to movement therapies, breath-work, meditation, Ayurvedic massage, and dietary supplements featuring targeted herbs.</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/file/?id=65376\" alt=\"\" class=\"topicImg\">\r\n\r\n<h3>Ayurvedic Herbs</h3>\r\n<p>Many practitioners of Ayurveda recommend herbs along with other lifestyle suggestions. Ayurvedic herbs are usually prescribed in combinations or formulas that include several different plants. The herbal formulas are sometimes in pill or tincture forms, and other times patients are asked to brew the herbs at home and drink as teas. Most Ayurvedic herbs, like most botanicals, have not been studied with conventional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Some cancer centers or communities may have Ayurvedic practitioners who work closely with oncology physicians and are knowledgeable about drug interactions and herbs. It is recommended that before using herbs during the active phase of cancer treatment, you speak with all your providers and ask for a referral to a trusted Ayurvedic or integrative provider to discuss safety and efficacy.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"NCCIH2018\" hint=\"National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, 2018\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65372", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00039","name":"CanHEAL Favorites","create_date":"2019-03-28","publish_date":"2019-03-28","related_docs":{},"categories":[],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna type=\"PIMUser\" name=\"userInfo\" loggedIn=\"true\">\r\n\t<ecs:dyna type=\"Analytics\" name=\"executeQuery\" queryId=\"646\">\r\n\t\t<ul class=\"card\">\r\n\t\t\t<li class=\"card-header card-header-title has-text-light has-background-primary\">Favorites</li>\r\n\t\t\t%%RECORDS%%\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:fragment name=\"recordFrag\">\r\n\t\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" notContains=\"path|ther_psy_toolkit\">\r\n\t\t\t<li class=\"card-content\"><a href=\"/%%path%%\">%%name%%</a></li>\r\n\t\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n\t</ecs:fragment>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:fragment name=\"noRecordsFrag\">\r\n\t\t\t<li class=\"card-content\">You have no favorites saved.

Therapy is not generally a one-size-fits-all approach. It can take time to find the right therapist or right approach to therapy, but it is worth the effort. Many studies have confirmed that therapy or counseling, used by itself, or in combination with medications or other treatments, can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. A trusted therapist should have at least a Mater&#39;s level of training/education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a \"problem-focused\" and \"action-oriented\" form of therapy that helps to identify thought distortions which results in anxious or depressed behaviors.  The therapist then assists in creating new goals, processing difficult situations, and creating healthy coping mechanisms that improve the quality of life. According to Yale Medicine, more than 60% of women with cancer and 40% of men experience sexual dysfunction or intimacy issues in their relationship. CBT can be helpful in working through these barriers. Those with previous emotional trauma prior to the cancer diagnosis may have more anxiety and depression and can benefit from CBT. Several studies have shown it to be as effective as antidepressant therapy in mild to moderate symptom management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides CBT, there are many other approaches that can be beneficial and have been shown to improve mood and enhance quality of life.  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) uses a mindfulness philosophy to help you  notice, accept, and embrace all of your emotions, including the negative ones. Cognitive-Based Compassion Therapy (CBCT) is a practice of increasing compassion for yourself and others through the development of a contemplative practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact a licensed psychologist or social worker in your area to discuss your concerns and set up a treatment plan. Keep in mind that psychology appointments are often, but not always covered by medical insurance, and it is worthwhile to inquire about this benefit. Most of the time several visits are required to resolve difficult issues, but the process is worth the effort because the rewards can be meaningful and sustained, and you are worth it.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"28489508\" hint=\"Irwin, 2017\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"28252882\" hint=\"Nakagawa, 2017\" /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"37286525\" hint=\"Pieramico, 2023\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Shortsleeve22\" hint=\"Shortsleeve 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Rupke2006\" hint=\"Rupke, 2006\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65485", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00041","name":"Sleep and Cancer","create_date":"2019-04-03","publish_date":"2018-01-03","related_docs":{},"categories":["Lifestyle"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_LIFE\" cat_name=\"Lifestyle\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t<h2>Sleep and Cancer</h2>\r\n\r\n\t<p>According to the American Sleep Apnea Association, 50&ndash;70 million Americans, 1-3 adults, struggle with a sleep disorder. Sleep\r\n\t\tdisorders include insomnia, circadian rhythm disorders, sleep apnea, snoring, and sleep deprivation. It is important\r\n\t\tto recognize and seek treatment for sleep disorders, as many of them can result in increased risk of chronic\r\n\t\tdisease, pain, obesity, and maybe even cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Many people who never struggled with insomnia find they have difficulty sleeping after a cancer diagnosis. There are\r\n\t\ta few different reasons this may occur.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Stress, Anxiety, and Depression</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\tA cancer diagnosis can be very stressful and disorienting, and the related anxiety can lead to sleeplessness or\r\n\t\t\tinsomnia. Depression and anxiety are correlated with poor sleep. Just as stress or anxiety can lead to sleeping\r\n\t\t\tproblems, sleep deprivation can lead to increased anxiety and depression. In fact, some studies show that treating\r\n\t\t\tsleep disorders can resolve a great proportion of depression symptoms.<br />\r\n\t\t\tSimple relaxation techniques at bedtime can be added to pre-bed rituals and other ways to decrease anxiety and\r\n\t\t\thelp with sleep. In addition, it may be necessary to explore professional assistance with anxiety and depression.\r\n\t\t\tMedications, supplements, and/or counseling/therapy may be helpful.</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Medications </strong><br />\r\n\t\t\tSteroids or other medications that are stimulating may lead to poor sleep.&nbsp;<br />\r\n\t\t\tBe sure to discuss your medications with your physician or pharmacist, to determine if it may be leading to poor\r\n\t\t\tsleep. Sometimes, just changing the time of day that you take your medications can make a\r\n\t\t\tdifference.</li>\r\n\t\t<li><strong>Pain and Discomfort</strong><br />\r\n\t\t\tMany people that have a cancer diagnosis also have cancer-related pain or other uncomfortable symptoms.<br />\r\n\t\t\tIf physical symptoms are keeping you awake at night, be sure to speak with your physician, as there may be a\r\n\t\t\tmedication or other treatment that can help. Pain is a particularly important consideration, because poor sleep\r\n\t\t\tcan worsen pain, just like pain can worsen sleep. This cycle must be addressed at both the pain and sleep levels.\r\n\t\t\tOften, improving sleep can improve pain, and vice versa.</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\r\n\t<p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/circadian_rhythm.html\">Circadian rhythm</a> is the natural 24-hour cycle of physical, mental, and behavioral changes\r\nthat the body goes through each day, which plays a significant role in sleep. To improve your circadian rhythm, be sure to spend at least 20 minutes outdoors every day, as this has been shown to\r\n\t\timprove sleep in newly diagnosed cancer patients. You do not need to be in the direct sun&mdash;just be sure to take your\r\n\t\tsunglasses off for at least that amount of time, so that the retina at the back of your eyes are able to produce\r\n\t\tnatural melatonin needed for regular sleep rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Additionally, some studies have found that sleeping 3&ndash;7 days outdoors (like camping), can re-set\r\n\t\tdysfunctional circadian rhythms.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Explore</h3>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"collapsibleInSet\" heading=\"Sleeping Pills\" first=\"yes\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<h3>Sleeping Pills</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>There are several studies that link the use of hypnotic or sedative medications used for sleep to increased rates\r\n\t\t\tof chronic disease, including cancer. Many people rely on sleeping pills to get to sleep at night, yet the data\r\n\t\t\tsurrounding this issue remains difficult to interpret. If you take regular medications to help you sleep, it is\r\n\t\t\timportant to discuss the risks and benefits of this with your health care provider. If you choose to stop these\r\n\t\t\tmedications in preference of gentler therapies or natural sleep, it is usually medically necessary to wean down\r\n\t\t\tslowly to avoid withdrawal symptoms. Generally, the longer you have been using sleeping pills,\r\n\t\t\tthe more slowly you should come off of them. The good news is that most people can wean off hypnotic\r\n\t\t\tmedications when they do so slowly, with a committed and structured plan, aided by a professional.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryId=\"33019585\" hint=\"Peng, 2020\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryId=\"Kripke18\" hint=\"Kripke 2018\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryId=\"29973038\" hint=\"Kim 2018\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" />\r\n\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"collapsibleInSet\" heading=\"Teas &amp; Botanicals\">\r\n\t\t<h3>Teas &amp; Botanicals</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>There are many teas and botanicals that are soothing and can be used to help reduce anxiety and improve sleep.\r\n\t\t\tTry these 30-60 minutes before bed.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Calming bedtime teas include:</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<ul>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Chamomile</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Lemon Balm</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Valerian</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Passionflower</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Magnolia</li>\r\n\t\t\t<li>Lavender</li>\r\n\t\t</ul>\r\n\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"collapsibleInSet\" heading=\"Magnesium\">\r\n\t\t<h3>Magnesium</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Magnesium has also been found to be calming and is good for many biological functions, including sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/magnesium.html\">Learn more about Magnesium</a></p>\r\n\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"collapsibleInSet\" heading=\"Melatonin\">\r\n\t\t<h3>Melatonin</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Melatonin supplementation can help with falling asleep and staying asleep or getting back to sleep more easily.\r\n\t\t</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/melatonin.html\">See More about Melatonin</a></p>\r\n\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"collapsibleInSet\" heading=\"Aromatherapy\">\r\n\t\t<h3>Aromatherapy</h3>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>You can try putting a few drops of a calming essential oil such as lavender or chamomile on your pillow, or a\r\n\t\t\thandkerchief on your bedside table, at night.

Being physically active is associated with a lower risk of many types of cancer including bladder, breast, colon, endometrial, esophageal, kidney and stomach cancers. In addition to improving health and increasing fitness, exercise has been shown to improve many side effects of cancer including:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fatigue</li>\r\n\t<li>Mood</li>\r\n\t<li>Sleep</li>\r\n\t<li>Pain</li>\r\n\t<li>Stamina</li>\r\n\t<li>Balance</li>\r\n\t<li>Muscle strength</li>\r\n\t<li>Lymphedema</li>\r\n\t<li>General body function (e.g., after surgery)</li>\r\n\t<li>May increase lifespan</li>\r\n\t<li>Improves quality of life in many other ways</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Physical activity can be any activity that requires movement of the body. Common activities include:</p>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"topicImg\" src=\"/file/65503/dogWalk-947315084.jpg\" />\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Walking</li>\r\n\t<li>Household chores like vacuuming or laundry</li>\r\n\t<li>Painting</li>\r\n\t<li>Gardening</li>\r\n\t<li>Taking the stairs</li>\r\n\t<li>Stretching</li>\r\n\t<li>Dancing</li>\r\n\t<li>Movement classes (like aerobics, yoga, Tai Chi, martial arts, etc)</li>\r\n\t<li>Traditional types of exercise (like jogging, swimming, cycling, sports, gym equipment, etc.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Do what you like or try something new. The most important thing is to get some healthy movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Safety</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For most people with cancer, physical activity is safe if there is awareness of physical limitations. It&rsquo;s best to discuss any possible limitations with your doctor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Examples of times when physical activity might be risky or need to be modified, include:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bone fractures, tumors or other conditions that might lead to injury to bones, muscles or joints</li>\r\n\t<li>Fragile heart conditions</li>\r\n\t<li>Shortness of breath</li>\r\n\t<li>Recovery from surgery or other procedures</li>\r\n\t<li>Dizziness, low blood pressure, weakness, easy bleeding, poor balance or high risk of falling</li>\r\n\t<li>Altered mental status or confusion</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>What&rsquo;s the right amount of activity?</strong></h3>\r\n<img alt=\"\" class=\"topicImg\" src=\"  /file/65248/activity-658596928.jpg\" />\r\n<p>Physical activity recommendations can vary depending on an individual&rsquo;s fitness level or physical limitations. It is important to pay close attention to sensations in your body and to build your exercise tolerance up slowly and steadily to avoid injury or over-exhaustion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most experts recommend at least 150 minutes to- 300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes to- 100 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise weekly. This exercise can be divided up over the course of the week into times that work for you. Moderate-intensity exercise includes brisk walking, light bicycling, heavy housework (vacuuming, mopping, etc). It is also important to do resistance training (with resistance bands, weights, or through yoga or gardening, etc) twice weekly.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people need to work towards regular exercise, while others can comfortably endure much higher levels of physical activity. If physical activity has become challenging, you may consider just starting with a 5-10 minute walk each day as you work to increase your fitness goals. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter how long or how intense your exercise is, it is also important to reduce the time that you spend sitting. Being sedentary is its own risk factor for cancer and for death from cancer. Interrupt prolonged periods of sitting with short walks, stretches, dancing, shaking or movement of any kind. It is ideal to move your body for at least a few minutes for every 60-90 minutes spent sitting.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Cancer Center and Community Offerings</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many cancer centers offer gentle exercise classes such as yoga (also chair yoga), Tai Chi, or other gentle movements for people at all levels of fitness or illness. Additionally, if you have a particular physical activity limitation, your physician or other provider may be able to recommend physical therapy for strength building, flexibility, and general functional improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many communities offer free or low-cost activities for cancer survivors such as cancer meet-up exercise, hiking or wellness, groups, fitness classes, or other movement activities. Explore your local resources for activities that can help you feel comfortable with movement and exercise, build community and relationships, and improve your fitness and morale.</p>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_PHYS\" />\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"36077690\" hint=\"Misiąg, 2022\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"NCIPhysical\" hint=\"National Cancer Institute Feb 10, 2020\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"35612669\" hint=\"Hermelink, 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64066", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00127","name":"Guided Imagery","create_date":"2019-06-18","publish_date":"2019-07-08","related_docs":{},"categories":["Mind-Body"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Guided Imagery</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided imagery is a form of deliberate, directed daydreaming. It is a purposeful use of the imagination to support health and healing. It deploys evocative words and phrases, usually accompanied by music, that are designed to create rich, multi-sensory fantasy and memory. The immersive voice tone, relaxed pacing and choice of language and music create a hypnotic, receptive mind-state that is ideal for supporting desired changes in mind, body, psyche, and spirit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagery is a specific kind of hypnosis that also falls under the general category of meditation. In Europe, it is often called autogenic training because it is self-generated and originates from self. Calling it \"visualization\" is misleading. Effective guided imagery uses, not just sight, but also sound, smell, taste and—most importantly—feel. It can also evoke emotion to enhance its efficacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided imagery can be useful for a large variety of symptoms, including general wellness, reducing stress and anxiety, anger management, and enhanced self-esteem.  In cancer, it has been shown to improve:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Fatigue</li>\r\n\t<li>Insomnia</li>\r\n\t<li>Nausea/vomiting</li>\r\n\t<li>Anxiety</li>\r\n\t<li>General distress</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4><strong>&nbsp;Try This</strong></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaiser Permanente has an open access page that offers 20 imagery streams:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://members.kaiserpermanente.org/redirects/listen/?kp_shortcut_referrer=kp.org/listen/\" target=\"_blank\">Guided Imagery Audios Online</a>.&nbsp; Options include Cancer: Coping; Cancer: Chemotherapy; Cancer: Radiation Therapy; Pain; Stress; Relaxation and Wellness; Sleep</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why It Works</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 3 basic, operating principles behind the effectiveness of guided imagery:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li value=\"NaN\">To the body, sensory images created in the mind are almost as real as actual events.</li>\r\n\t<li value=\"NaN\">In a relaxed, altered trance-like state, we are capable of more rapid and intense healing, growth, learning and change.</li>\r\n\t<li value=\"NaN\">When we have at our disposal a technique that gives us a sense of autonomy and locus of control, we are empowered to feel better and do better.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Guided imagery, by its very nature, combines all three of these principles, resulting in a user-friendly, versatile, portable inner tool kit, available any time and any place, to help people maximally achieve their healing or performance goals.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34511805\"  /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"27341675\"  /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"28069156\"  /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "66150", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00120","name":"Feedback","create_date":"2019-06-06","publish_date":"2019-06-07","related_docs":{},"categories":[],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Give Feedback</h2>\r\n<p>Thanks for registering for the CanHEAL toolkit.

Exceptions to this include unstable bone fractures, infection, some heart or lung conditions, recent recovery from surgery or other procedures, or individuals at high risk of falling. If you are unsure, ask your surgeon or physician what types of physical activity might be safe for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting active before surgery has many advantages. Recovery from surgery can take weeks, sometimes much longer. Being physically fit, to the best of your ability, before surgery will improve your recovery and help you bounce back more quickly to your usual state of fitness. Most experts recommend 150 minutes of exercise weekly, which can convert to 30 minutes 5 days per week. For some people, this is a goal to work towards, while others can comfortably endure much higher levels of physical activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prehabilitation (Prehab)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A growing number of cancer centers now offer opportunities for &lsquo;prehabilitation&rsquo;, or prehab. Prehab is a program dedicated to preparing patients for surgery with physical activity and physical therapy exercises designed to speed recovery. Ask your surgery team if there are prehab opportunities in your community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you can&rsquo;t find a prehabilitation program in your community, be sure to stay as fit and active as you safely can in the weeks preceding surgery.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourceItems\" title=\"NPR- Your Health: Patients Do Better After Surgery If They Do &#39;Prehab&#39; First\" link=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2014/10/29/359343261/patients-do-better-after-surgery-if-they-do-prehab-first\" first=\"yes\" last=\"yes\">\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>After Surgery</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After surgery, there is usually a period of rest that can last days to weeks. Different types of surgery will require different periods of rest. Physical activity modifications may be necessary depending on which part of the body was operated on, and the outcome of the surgery. It is important to start moving your body within the week following surgery with activities such as walking and gentle stretching. Gently increase physical activity as soon as you safely can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many cancer centers offer rehabilitation, or rehab programs or referrals. These programs are usually covered by medical insurance and are designed to increase function soon after surgery, guided by a professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t qualify for a certified rehabilitation program, be sure to get moving when you safely can, using gentle stretching and movement early in your recovery period. Not only can early activity help restore function, it may decrease scarring and other surgical complications.

In cancer, lymphatic flow can be disrupted by multiple mechanisms.&nbsp; Surgeries that remove lymph nodes to evaluate them for malignancy (cancer) have the potential to cause lymphedema as a side effect.&nbsp; For this reason, in a few cancers such as breast cancer or melanoma, some surgeons practice &lsquo;sentinel node biopsy&rsquo;.&nbsp; This is a process of finding the lymph node(s) that the primary tumor might drain into during the surgery, leading to the removal of fewer lymph nodes. The removal of fewer lymph nodes reduce the risk of lymphedema of the nearest limb or body region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also reduce the risk of lymphedema by staying fit before surgery with regular physical activity.&nbsp; Excess body weight is associated with higher risk of lymphedema. Light weightlifting or weight bearing exercises, especially in the extremities at risk, can increase muscle mass and reduce body fat, decreasing chances of limb swelling after surgery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Staying hydrated by drinking water, reducing salt intake, decreasing processed foods, and eating a diet rich in vegetables, whole grains and fruits, with adequate healthy protein might also help reduce risk of lymphedema.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) is a type of very light massage that encourages lymphatic flow in people who have developed lymphedema. The touch is directed gently along the skin towards the thoracic duct, which is in the center of the chest area near the heart.

Of most concern are polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) because they are widely produced and many break down slowly so they can build up in body tissues causing damage to many body systems including reproductive, childhood developmental, immune, hormone balance, respiratory, and cardiovascular. Many of these chemicals increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, and some cancers. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be overwhelming just to think about it! While it’s true that there are many chemicals to worry about, it’s also true that the body has an innate <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/supporting_detoxification.html\">detoxification</a> system that helps eliminate these chemicals. In addition, there are ways to limit exposure which also helps reduce the body’s burden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Goal: Reduce Exposure as Much as Possible</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The recommendations found in this toolkit will help you reduce exposure by taking small steps that will add up to big gains.

BPA has a similar molecular structure to estrogen and its synthetic cousin, diethylstilbestrol (DES), a known carcinogen. Because of these similarities, BPA is considered a potent EDC. Products that are labeled “BPA Free” are not necessarily safer because the alternate chemicals used have similar molecular structures as BPA.

You cannot be upset if your breathing is slow, deep, quiet, and regular. You cannot always center yourself emotionally by an act of will, but you can make your breathing slow, deep, quiet, and regular, and the rest will follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Video Examples</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/clinicianHandout/?hid=CLH00048\" target=\"_blank\">Handout: 4-7-8 Breath (PDF) </a></p>\r\n<ecs:dyna type=\"Media\" name=\"displayMedia\" playlistId=\"244\" loginOptional=\"true\" ></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<h3>Breathwork Minis</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Minis: focused breathing techniques for immediate effect to reduce anxiety and tension&mdash;any place, any time, and no one will know you are doing it&mdash;can do while stuck in traffic&hellip; while walking&hellip;while on hold in a phone call &hellip; while waiting in your doc&rsquo;s office &hellip; when someone says something that bothers you &hellip; in the dentist chair &hellip; when you feel overwhelmed &hellip; while standing in line&hellip;.

There are trillions of bacteria in the gut that help regulate metabolism, mood, and immune system, among other biologic processes. Fiber feeds these bacteria which helps keep the gut healthy to ensure all of the important processes function properly. The gut microbiome plays a key role in overall health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Prevention/Protection</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Increased fiber intake has been shown to be protective against a variety of cancers including breast, colon, prostate, pancreatic, and others. Fiber slows the absorption of sugar in the diet, thereby keeping blood sugar in a healthy range, which is important for diabetes as well as cancer prevention. Eating more fiber can also help you feel full and eat less to maintain normal body weight which also reduces risk of cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Whole Foods and Types of Fiber</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiber is best ingested in real food such as whole grains, vegetables, and fruits, as opposed to processed fiber supplements that come in pills or powders. However, if you are finding it difficult to eat enough of these fiber-rich foods, taking a high-quality fiber supplement may help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two major types of fiber: soluble and insoluble. Both types are important for gut health.<b> Soluble fiber blends</b> with water, forming a gel-like substance and reduces sugar spikes. Examples of soluble fiber include oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas and apples. <b>Insoluble fiber</b> does not blend with water, so it passes through the digestive system mostly intact, acting as a &lsquo;bulking agent&rsquo; in the digestive tract. Insoluble fiber helps speed the passage of food and waste through the gut and supports the gut microbiome. Examples of insoluble fiber include whole grains, vegetables such as cauliflower, spinach and radishes, and legumes such as beans and lentils. As you can see, many whole foods contain both soluble and insoluble fibers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soluble fiber appears to be particularly important in cancer risk reduction. For example, eating 5 grams of soluble fiber daily is associated with a 5% reduction in the risk of breast cancer. This isn’t hard! One third cup of black beans or one cup of Brussels sprouts have 5g of soluble fiber. A sweet potato has about 2g of soluble fiber, a pear or 3.5oz of broccoli each has about 1.5g of soluble fiber. </p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Special Needs: Registered Dietitian Consult</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have an ileostomy, colostomy, risk factors for intestinal blockage, or other issue that requires specialized nutrition, please discuss your fiber requirements and other nutritional limitations with a trusted registered dietician. Many cancer centers offer nutritional support and individualized nutrition consultation.</p>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"37299507\" hint=\"Hu, 2023\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"22234738\" hint=\"Aune, 2012\" /></p> \r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65748", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00067","name":"Integrative Cancer Care","create_date":"2019-05-16","publish_date":"2019-05-16","related_docs":{},"categories":["Navigating Cancer Care"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Integrative Cancer Care</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Integrative cancer care is individualized, holistic care that includes any healing strategies that can help encourage healing with limited potential for harm. <strong>Treatment plans often incorporate healthy lifestyle and complementary healing modalities in conjunction with standard oncology care.</strong> The healthcare provider who is delivering integrative oncology care serves a vital role. In addition to the oncologist, this could be another team member with integrative oncology training, for example, a pediatrician, family and community medicine, gynecologist, or internal medicine provider. Or in some cases a complementary medicine provider such as a traditional Chinese medicine-trained acupuncturist, herbalist, naturopathic physician, or other integrative health professional may be part of your treatment team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the integrative provider is not your primary oncologist, then it is critical to communicate effectively and coordinate with your primary oncologist. The integrative oncology provider should work collaboratively to create an individualized integrative treatment plan that considers the cancer treatment stage (i.e., in treatment or post-treatment), and anticipates and accounts for the changing nature of the cancer landscape (e.g., expected side effects of chemotherapy or cancer recurrence) as skillfully as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Open communication is important to coordinate care, avoid any adverse interactions, and encourage families to feel comfortable discussing all types of treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Finding a Qualified Integrative Provider</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure that any integrative provider you choose to work with has clear training in integrative medicine and/or substantial experience with integrative oncology. It is important to ask any integrative provider you choose to work with about their training and experience in integrative oncology, as well as their willingness and ability to communicate openly with your primary oncology team such as your surgeon, oncologist, or radiation oncologist, when appropriate. This is particularly important during your active cancer treatment phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qualified physicians can complete an Integrative Medicine Fellowship, like the&nbsp;Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine&nbsp;(AWCIM) IM Fellowship. They are then eligible to sit for the Integrative Medicine Board Exam (ABOIM)&nbsp; and become board certified in integrative medicine.

Processed foods are less processed than ultra-processed foods and include items like bread, tofu, cheese, and canned food like canned beans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultra-processed foods are pre-packaged foods that tend to have more preservatives and artificial flavors and colors, as well as more added fat, sugar, and salt, all of which are harmful to health. These include foods like flavored salty snacks, pre-packaged desserts and candy, energy drinks and sodas, packaged meats, French fries and fast food, margarine, and sauces. The consumption of ultra-processed food has been linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, mental health issues, and cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research in this area continues to grow. For example, a study of over 100,000 French adults found that ultra-processed foods significantly increased cancer risk. The results showed that a 10% increase in ultra-processed food consumption resulted in a 12% increase in risk of developing any kind of cancer. Another large study featuring more than 114,000 US nurses found that eating ultra-processed foods significantly increased the risk of premature death from a variety of illnesses including cancer. In that study, the most egregious foods were ready-to-eat meat products, sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages, dairy based desserts, and processed breakfast foods. Ultra-processed foods should be avoided as much as possible.</p>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Lane2024\" hint=\"Lane, 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"29444771\" hint=\"Fiolet, 2018\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Fang2024\" hint=\"Fang 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65751", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00034","name":"Mindful Eating","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Diets and Eating Patterns"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Mindful Eating</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>How we eat may be as important as what we eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindless eating involves eating 'automatically', eating when we aren't really hungry, not paying attention to the food we're eating, and overeating. All people eat 'mindlessly' or automatically sometimes. Some people do this frequently which can lead to significant weight problems or eating unhealthy foods. Other people overeat compulsively when stressed which can be a form of binge eating defined as eating very large amounts of food at one time at least 1-2 times/week. Binge eating is certainly a form of mindless eating that can be combatted by mindful eating. In fact, research shows that mindful eating not only helps reduce binge frequency, but it can also help ease symptoms of anxiety and depression.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindful eating helps you be more aware of your food choices, brings your attention to the eating experience, and encourages the selection and preparation of foods that are not only satisfying but nourishing. Specific to cancer, research demonstrates that mindful eating can have several benefits including enhanced optimism, self-compassion, compassion for others, relationship satisfaction, relaxation, and happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Paths to Mindful Eating</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Eating more slowly and enjoying the food with all of your senses engaged is the foundational aspect of mindful eating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using mindfulness and awareness practices you can change your relationship with food which will help you eat less and truly enjoy your healthier food choices more. Doing so can help you stay balanced at a healthier weight and experience a calmer, peaceful, and even joyful relationship with food.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Core Principles</h4>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Bringing your awareness to your experience of eating, rather than approaching meals or snacks mindlessly or automatically.</li>\r\n\t<li>Learning to distinguish between physical and psychological hunger.</li>\r\n\t<li>Learning to savor each bite of food &mdash; and stopping when your taste buds get &#39;tired&#39;.</li>\r\n\t<li>Learning to stop before becoming overly full.</li>\r\n\t<li>Choosing foods both for personal satisfaction and for nutritional value.</li>\r\n\t<li>Creating meals that engage all of your senses.</li>\r\n\t<li>AND learning to become more self-accepting in creating a healthier relationship to eating and food.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"36397211\" hint=\"Morillo-Sarto, 2023\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Badaghi2024\" hint=\"Badaghi 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/cancerToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"subNavPanel\" href=\"/cancertoolkit/nutrition.html\" subname=\"Nutrition\" category=\"CANTK_NUT\"></ecs:dyna>", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65747", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00105","name":"Nutrition and Cancer Surgery","create_date":"2019-05-23","publish_date":"2019-05-21","related_docs":{},"categories":["Surgery"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<p><strong>Before Surgery</strong><br />\r\n\tEating a healthy Mediterranean-type diet filled with many vegetables is a good idea most of the time, including during the weeks preceding surgery. Getting the right nutrients can help ensure your body has all the micronutrients needed for a healthy immune system and quick recovery. Many nutrition experts also recommend increasing protein intake in the weeks before surgery. Foods such as cottage cheese, yogurt, fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, legumes (beans), and soy are healthy ways to increase protein during those weeks.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>Optimal hydration is also critical in the weeks and days preceding surgery. Be sure to drink plenty of water to ensure proper blood flow and to protect your organs such as your kidneys. Hydration is important before and after surgery.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p><strong>When to stop eating/drinking pre-surgery</strong><br />\r\n\tYour surgical team will instruct you about when to stop eating and drinking in anticipation of your surgery. Often people are asked to stop eating or drinking after dinner the night before surgery is scheduled to reduce chances of surgical complications while under anesthesia.</p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p><strong>After Surgery</strong></p>\r\n\t\r\n\t<p>After surgery, your surgical team will instruct you about when you can return to a normal healthy diet. Some people will need to advance their diet slowly, especially after abdominal or gastrointestinal surgeries, starting with fluids, or soft &ldquo;clear&rdquo; foods, without fiber in the days immediately following surgery. Others can start on a normal diet a day or so after surgery. After several days, you should be able to return to a normal, healthy diet.

This has been described over millennia by many independent cultures as Mana, Prana, Chi, Qi, and other culturally relevant terms. The energy field can be directed and enhanced with the use of intention, touch, and breathwork to promote healing of self or others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many varieties of energy-healing modalities, some which have become more popularized than others. Some examples include Reiki, Johrei, Quantum Touch, Healing Touch, Therapeutic Touch, Qi Gong, and prayer that is specific for health such as praying for the healing of another person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a healing quality to the energy transmitted by the therapist which can be even felt over long distances. A recent study in Turkey found that Reiki administered over a long distance resulted in a significant reduction of pain, stress and fatigue in oncology patients as compared to a control group that did not receive the healing treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Potential Benefits</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The National Institute of Medicine recognizes treatments using these modalities as being beneficial and refers to this as the bio energy field. There are several studies showing benefit from energy modalities including wound healing, reduced pain, and less anxiety in post-surgical patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy healing techniques have been found to be beneficial for several symptoms including anxiety, depression, pain reduction, wound healing, nausea, fatigue, irritable bowel, headaches, and more. Energy Medicine cannot treat cancer, but it can be effective in managing related symptoms and improving overall wellness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>How To Find Trained Practitioners?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Energy healing is typically practiced by trained professionals, and there are various levels of training and certification that are required. Some people feel drawn to practice that work on themselves or to become more skilled as an energy healer. There are books available to learn energy techniques, but taking classes or obtaining treatment from a skilled practitioner is a more direct and therapeutic way to start. Many modalities teach self-care methods when learning their energy medicine discipline. You may receive this therapy in an inpatient or outpatient setting, or in the home. Many hospitals now have Holistic Nurses or Integrative Medicine departments with these types of practitioners. Long distance sending of energy is also possible by contacting experienced practitioners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Healing Touch</strong> is taught and practiced in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, long term care, end of life care, schools, private practices, homes, disasters, accident scenes, including community outreach worldwide. It is open to health care professionals and anyone with a sincere interest in healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are currently two major organizations that teach Healing Touch technique:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healing Touch Program - <a href=\"http://www.healingtouchprogram.com/\" target=\"_blank\">healingtouchprogram.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healing Beyond Borders: Healing Touch International website <a href=\"http://healingbeyondborders.org/index.php/about\" target=\"_blank\">Healing Beyond Borders website</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Healing touch has many benefits including reducing pain and anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Reiki</b> is a healing practice that originated in Japan. Reiki practitioners place their hands lightly on or just above the person receiving treatment with the goal of facilitating the person's own healing response. Reiki is most often used as a method of energy transference by means of touch or contact with the physical, mental, emotional, spiritual or energetic body. It can also be used for long-distance healing. Reiki is used by people looking to promote overall health and well-being, as well as by those who are seeking relief from disease-related symptoms and the side effects of conventional medical treatments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More information on Reiki can be found at <a href=\"http://www.reiki.org/\" target=\"_blank\">reiki.org</a>.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"/>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34387236 \" hint=\"Karaman, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"26453532\" hint=\"Foley, 2016\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"33654502\" hint=\"Gentile, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"37792581\" hint=\"Conway, 2024\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65191", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00069","name":"Magnesium","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Magnesium</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Magnesium is necessary for a multitude of important processes in the human body. Magnesium is an essential component in over 300 enzymatic reactions including the metabolism of carbohydrates and fats for energy, DNA synthesis, cell signaling, and supporting the body’s antioxidant defense systems. Additionally, magnesium plays a vital role in muscle and nerve conduction, normal heart rhythm, and bone health.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Deficiencies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many Americans are deficient in magnesium because of inadequate diet, medications that deplete magnesium, and modern agricultural practices that deplete the soil of magnesium and other minerals. Many people eat a healthy diet but still might be deficient and require a magnesium supplement. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<strong>several types of chemotherapy drugs deplete magnesium</strong>, which can cause dangerously low magnesium levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Checking for low magnesium with a standard laboratory blood test is not usually an accurate measure of magnesium levels in the body. This is because magnesium is stored within the skeleton or in the cells. A standard blood test will often miss a true magnesium deficiency, unless cellular magnesium levels are specifically tested, which is a test that may not be covered by most insurance plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Symptoms of magnesium deficiency vary widely and can include muscle cramping, headaches, poor concentration, irritability or constipation. Magnesium supplementation is generally safe and easy, but it is important to have guidance with dosing and types of magnesium.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Type and Dose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a variety of types of magnesium on the market for sale. Magnesium citrate (the vitamin, NOT the laxative!) is probably the most affordable and effective type of magnesium. It can loosen stools, so people prone to diarrhea should choose another type. Magnesium glycinate is available at most health food stores and is easier on the digestive system and less likely to loosen stools as compared to magnesium citrate. Magnesium oxide is often prescribed for magnesium deficiency, but it may not be as well absorbed as the other forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For magnesium citrate and magnesium glycinate, doses of about 400 mg are generally adequate, though most providers suggest working your way up slowly to this dose to ensure that you are tolerating it well. If you develop diarrhea, try lowering the dose. Magnesium is a large molecule and therefore it often takes more than one capsule/tablet to reach a dose as high as 400 mg. Be sure to read the Serving Size to verify how many capsules are needed to reach your desired dose. Magnesium citrate also can be found in powder form, which some people prefer over the larger capsules/tablets. The powder is mixed with water, using instructions found on the label to reach the desired dose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is usually recommended that magnesium be taken at bedtime, as it can be calming and many people take it to help with sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Food Sources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Magnesium is widely available in several foods. Legumes, nuts, dark leafy greens, halibut, unprocessed grains, and ready-to-eat fortified breakfast cereals are great sources of magnesium. Meat and dairy products are considered good sources as well. Cooked spinach, pumpkin seeds, black beans, almonds, and brown rice are also rich sources of magnesium.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Magnesium is generally safe when taken at doses of up to 500 mg daily in adults. As mentioned, magnesium can cause loose stools so refer to instructions above to determine which type of magnesium is best for your digestive system and then start with a lower dose and build from there.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"NIHMag2022\" hint=\"National Institutes of Health 2022\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65343", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00119","name":"Weight and Cancer","create_date":"2019-06-06","publish_date":"2019-06-06","related_docs":{},"categories":["Lifestyle"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_LIFE\" cat_name=\"Lifestyle\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2><strong>Weight and Cancer</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Risks Related to Obesity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Obesity or being overweight can affect health in many negative ways. Related to cancer, maintaining a healthy weight can decrease the risk in at least 18 different types of cancer, including brain, breast (in women past menopause), colon / rectal, endometrial, esophageal, gall bladder, kidney (renal), liver, myeloma, ovarian, pancreatic and stomach cancers. Additionally, weight loss can reduce the risk of cancer recurrence for cancer survivors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight. It is not a perfect tool, but BMI and health-related outcomes have been well-studied, and BMI has become a validated way to assess for obesity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aicr.org/reduce-your-cancer-risk/weight/tools_bmi_calculator.php\" target=\"_blank\">To calculate your BMI, use this calculator</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BMI Categories:&nbsp;<br />\r\nUnderweight = &lt;18.5<br />\r\nNormal weight = 18.5&ndash;24.9&nbsp;<br />\r\nOverweight = 25&ndash;29.9&nbsp;<br />\r\nObesity = BMI of 30 or great</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More meaningful than simply calculating BMI, is having a better understanding of the composition of your body, including how much body fat is present. Body fat can accumulate anywhere in the body, most commonly around the abdomen (apple-shaped) and hips (pear-shaped). Some studies suggest that fat around the abdomen may be more concerning for chronic disease such as diabetes and possibly cancer, perhaps because the fat tissue is surrounding vital body organs such as the liver and pancreas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_ORISK\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Cancer Treatment and Weight Gain</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Some cancer treatments, notably for breast, prostate or ovarian cancers, can promote weight gain. This is probably due to the hormonal-blocking effects of the cancer treatments. If you or your loved are gaining weight during cancer treatment, please request a visit with a registered dietician to help you manage this concerning side effect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, weight loss after cancer treatment has been associated with reduced recurrence of several types of cancer including breast, endometrial and color.</p>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_WGAIN\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Cancer Treatment and Weight Loss</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For many people with cancer, weight loss is a bigger concern than weight gain. Cancer is a metabolically active disease and can lead to reduction of body mass and even muscle loss in some cases. Cancer or cancer treatments can also lead to a variety of symptoms that can contribute to weight loss including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Changes in taste or smell</li>\r\n\t<li>Mouth sores or mouth pain</li>\r\n\t<li>Decreased appetite</li>\r\n\t<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>\r\n\t<li>Constipation</li>\r\n\t<li>Difficulty chewing or swallowing</li>\r\n\t<li>Depression or other mood changes</li>\r\n\t<li>Pain or discomfort</li>\r\n\t<li>Advancing disease</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If you or your loved one are experiencing unintentional weight loss during cancer treatment, it is important to address this issue early with your oncologist and consider a referral to an oncology-specialized dietician to discuss ways to stabilize weight and improve symptoms as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if food is not appetizing, it is important to stay well-hydrated by drinking water throughout treatment to improve treatment tolerance and decrease side effects such as electrolyte changes, toxin build-up, and to help protect the kidneys and other organs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Taste, Smell, and Appetite Changes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Frequently, during cancer or cancer treatment, taste, smell and appetite can change. Many types of chemotherapy result in temporary damage to taste buds, resulting in flavor changes to familiar foods. For some, this results in a metallic, bitter, or other unpleasant flavor. Others report changes in smell, so that the smell of the cooking of food might result in nausea, or the aroma of food is no longer appealing. These can result in appetite changes, leading to weight loss. Surgery and radiation therapy, as well as the cancer itself, can also lead to changes in taste, smell, and appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is imperative to discuss changes in taste, smell, appetite, or your weight with your oncologist or other health care provider, and possibly with a certified oncology dietician as well. Mouth pain, oral ulcers (mouth sores), discomfort with swallowing, constipation, medications, or a variety of other causes can also read to changes in appetite and possibly weight loss. These conditions should be treated or addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to take excellent care of your mouth and teeth during all phases of cancer and cancer treatment. Oral health is a critical component of whole health. If using traditional toothpaste is uncomfortable, you can change flavors, or make your own using coconut oil and baking soda. To do this, put a toothpaste amount of coconut oil onto your toothpaste, then dip into a small jar or bowl of baking soda, wet slightly, and brush normally.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"dbwacr\"  /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"obCancer\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"26991704\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"33235316\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"RecaldeM2023\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65814", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00091","name":"Mind-Body Moments","create_date":"2019-05-22","publish_date":"2019-05-22","related_docs":{},"categories":[],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" \r\n\t\tborderFragment=\"pagesList\" list_heading=\"Mind-Body Moments\" category=\"CANTK_MBM\" />", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "on", "main_image": null, "not_savable": "on", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00055","name":"Melatonin","create_date":"2019-05-06","publish_date":"2019-05-06","related_docs":{},"categories":["Mood & Emotion", "Sleep", "Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Melatonin</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Melatonin is a hormone that is made in the part of the brain called the pineal gland, as well as in the gastrointestinal tract (the gut). It helps to regulate circadian rhythms and enhances sleep. Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and helps strengthen the immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Natural light activates \"light receptors\", also known as photoreceptors, in the retina, which are located at the back of the eye. These receptors initiate the production of melatonin in the pineal gland, which may partially explain melatonin’s relationship with circadian rhythm and the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin is secreted in the evening and levels remain high throughout most of the night. Melatonin declines with age and some medications, such as some blood pressure medicines (e.g., beta-blockers), may also decrease natural melatonin levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since melatonin is also made in the gut, a healthy gut may be an important factor in maintaining healthy melatonin levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Usage</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Melatonin is one of the most well-researched dietary supplements in integrative oncology. Many studies have found that melatonin has anti-cancer activity and may promote the shrinking of solid tumors. This effect seems to be in part related to the immune-stimulating effects of melatonin. Melatonin also supports cell repair and apoptosis (death) of cancer cells. Clinical studies have found that melatonin supplementation in people with various solid tumor types leads to better tolerance of chemotherapy and radiation along with improved response to these treatments. For these reasons, melatonin is often recommended by integrative providers for people with cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of cancer care, the most common use of melatonin supplementation is to support better sleep and minimize jet lag.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Food Sources</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to being available as a dietary supplement, there are many plant-based foods that contain melatonin including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Flax seeds</li>\r\n\t<li>Orange bell peppers</li>\r\n\t<li>Tart cherry juice</li>\r\n\t<li>Walnuts</li>\r\n\t<li>Tomatoes</li>\r\n\t<li>Mustard seeds</li>\r\n\t<li>Goji berries</li>\r\n\t<li>Almonds</li>\r\n\t<li>Raspberries</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For trouble falling asleep, doses as low as 0.5 mg can be used, though melatonin can safely be used up to 20 mg nightly. Be aware that higher doses don’t necessarily help you sleep better.  If you are struggling with waking in the middle of the night, you may want to try a sustained release (or extended release) melatonin formulation. Taking melatonin supplements will not suppress your own production of melatonin nor is it addictive so  stopping it will not cause withdrawal symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Side Effects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The main side effect of melatonin is fatigue, so if you are feeling groggy the next morning, try a lower dose. Melatonin can also increase dreaming in some people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drug Interaction</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are taking the blood pressure medication nifedipine, some studies have found that taking melatonin at the same time may increase blood pressure and heart rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"alsoInButtons\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"33923028\" hint=\"Talib, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Mafi2023\" hint=\"Mafi, 2023\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65342", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00080","name":"Gratitude Practices","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Care of the Spirit"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_SPIRIT\" cat_name=\"Care of the Spirit\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Gratitude Practices</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is difficult to hold a negative thought while feeling grateful. A body of evidence has emerged suggesting that gratitude is related to wellbeing including mood, life satisfaction, and health-related quality of life. Creating a state of deep gratitude can even lower inflammation in the body and can shift the body’s autonomic nervous system out of sympathetic tone (fight, flight, or freeze modes) to the healing parasympathetic state (rest and digest).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some, gratitude also helps build resilience during hard times. Exploring gratitude in the face of life challenges is beneficial. You can be grateful about the choices you make. You can be grateful for people who support you on your journey. You can be grateful that other parts of your life are meaningful. You can be grateful that there may even be good things that grow out of your difficulty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that a weekly gratitude practice can increase general happiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Try This: Gratitude Journal</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people find that keeping a gratitude journal helps them nurture more appreciaiton. One way to practice being grateful is to write down three things that you are grateful for at the end of each day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A caring friend</li>\r\n\t<li>A devoted pet</li>\r\n\t<li>An amazing sunset</li>\r\n\t<li>A delicious meal</li>\r\n\t<li>A simple flower or natural delight</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Try This: Gratefulness Rituals</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A ritual is anything you practice regularly in the same way. Many people give thanks before a meal. Others count their blessings before sleep. What gratitude ritual will you add to your day?</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Try This: Practice Awe</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Awe is being amazed. Notice things in life that are truly remarkable. That may be large things like seeing the Grand Canyon. It may be thinking about how people have walked on the moon. It can also be small things, like how flowers bloom from a seed, or watching a bird in flight. According to the brilliant Albert Einstein, &quot;There are only two ways to live your <strong>life</strong>: as though nothing is a <strong>miracle</strong>, or as though everything is a <strong>miracle</strong>.&quot; Fortunately, there are many resources that can help you encourage more awe in your life.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34244182\" hint=\"Tan, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34163256\" hint=\"Tomczyk, 2021\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65193", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00026","name":"Diet for a Low Appetite","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Diets and Eating Patterns"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Diet for a Low Appetite</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the National Cancer Institute, loss of appetite is a common side effect of cancer and/or cancer treatments. Cancerous tumors can produce chemicals that suppress appetite. Cancer treatment can cause mouth sores which can make eating painful and decrease appetite. Other digestive symptoms such as bloating, constipation or diarrhea can impair appetite. Some patients feel too tired to eat. It is important to seek medical help for symptoms that are interfering with the ability to eat and if there is continuous, or significant, weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several strategies that can help someone with a low appetite to eat. Eating small meals frequently throughout the day can be an easier way to maintain caloric intake. Large meals can be overwhelming to someone with little interest in eating. It is also helpful to prepare food ahead of time and store the prepared meals in small portion-sized containers for easy access when there is an appetite. Adding a couple of drops of lemon juice and/or cooking spices to cooked foods can brighten the flavors and activate taste buds. Zinc supplementation can restore taste when taste changes from chemotherapy make it challenging to eat. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to emphasize nutrient-dense foods that are easy to digest and generally palatable. Some of these foods may include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>eggs </li>\r\n<li>greek style organic yogurt </li>\r\n<li>cooked grains (oatmeal, rice, quinoa, etc.) </li>\r\n<li>potatoes (especially sweet potatoes) </li>\r\n<li>blended soups </li>\r\n<li>whole grain crackers </li>\r\n<li>avocado (such as guacamole) </li>\r\n<li>warm temperature foods such as cooked fruit or, steamed and cooked vegetables </li>\r\n<li>coconut milk in curries or smoothies (use the milk found in cans not the coconut milk in cartons because the milk in the cartons is lower in calories) </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, persistent difficulty eating, especially when accompanied by weight loss, needs prompt medical evaluation.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"nihnciweight\" hint=\"National Cancer Institute Oct 15, 2024\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"subNavPanel\" href=\"/cancertoolkit/nutrition.html\" subname=\"Nutrition\" category=\"CANTK_NUT\"></ecs:dyna>", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65742", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00130","name":"Omega-3 Fatty Acids","create_date":"2022-01-06","publish_date":"2022-01-20","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t<h2>Omega-3 fatty acids</h2>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Omega-3 fatty acids contribute to health in many ways. Our cells cannot make omega-3 fatty acids so we must consume them. The most health-promoting omega-3 fatty acids are eicosatetraenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Foods that contain EPA and DHA are fish, seafood, grass-fed beef, algae, seeds, and nuts. Omega-3 fatty acids in plant foods are comprised of alpha-linolenic acids (ALA). Once ingested, ALA is broken down into EPA and DHA. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Deficiencies</h3>\r\n\r\n\t<p>The optimal blood level of omega-3 is expressed as a percentage of the fatty acids in red blood cell membranes which are EPA and DHA. The optimal level of omega-3 fatty acids are approximately 8%. Vegetarians can be deficient in EPA and DHA because it is difficult for the body to convert sufficient ALA into enough EPA and DHA. Additionally, anyone who does not regularly eat seafood, seeds, and nuts may be deficient. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>There are blood tests available to check blood levels of omega-3 and other fatty acids with the most well-studied test being the OmegaQuant®. These tests can be self-ordered or ordered by healthcare practitioners although they may not be covered by insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>While deficiency of omega-3 is rare, most modern Western diets have too much omega-6 fatty acids that are found in a wide variety of grains and processed foods, and not enough omega-3s. This relative deficiency is linked with inflammatory joint pain, impaired immunity, increased risk of coronary artery disease, and increased risk of muscle wasting (sarcopenia). Omega-3 deficiency can be addressed with diet and/or supplementation. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Role of Omega-3 fatty acids in cancer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having sufficient omega-3 fatty acids may be associated with a lower risk of cancer, especially colon and breast cancers.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Omega-3 supplementation with conventional chemotherapy treatment may improve the anti-cancer effects of the chemotherapy, especially for colorectal cancer, breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Omega-3 fatty acids can also improve tolerance to conventional treatment by reducing joint pain, supporting a balanced mood, lowering the risk of peripheral neuropathy, and decreasing the risk of loss of lean muscle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Type and Dose</h3>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Supplemental omega-3 is most commonly in the form of fish oil, with algae oil or ground flaxseeds appropriate for vegetarians. Although fish oil supplements are commonly available, the quality varies considerably. Because fish oil can be contaminated with heavy metals, fish oil products should be tested for heavy metals, especially mercury.  Fish oil can also become rancid, especially when packaged in clear bottles which allows light to oxidize the fatty acids. Rancid fish oil will have a strong fishy odor. </p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>The dosage of fish oil varies depending upon the indication for its use. Nonetheless, a commonly studied and recommended dose is between 1g – 2g of omega-3 daily as EPA and DHA. Fish oil supplements should always be taken with food to avoid fishy burps.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n\t<p>High doses of fish oil can cause diarrhea, nausea, and fishy burps. Your doctor may want you to stop taking fish oil prior to surgery due to concerns about increased bleeding risk. While clinical research has not proven this risk, caution and health provider supervision is best for someone undergoing surgery. Additionally, if you are taking a blood thinner (anti-coagulant), fish oil should be discontinued. </p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_BASICS\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34606391\" hint=\"Wang, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34488585\" hint=\"Soni, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "91832", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00079","name":"Meditation & Mindfulness","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Care of the Spirit", "Mind-Body"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Meditation &amp; Mindfulness</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mindfulness means keeping your thoughts and feelings in the present moment.

Meditation prior and during chemotherapy can decrease anxiety by nearly 50%. Meditation can be used individually with audio, video, or phone apps, or in group settings. Start a daily practice for yourself, even if you  just start with 5-7 minutes per day with a goal of 20 minutes daily.  This is because twenty minutes daily of contemplative practice such as meditation or mindfulness has been shown to boost the immune system, among other benefits.  Meditation is best practiced either in the early morning or before bedtime, though many seasoned practitioners prefer early morning because they are more alert at that time of day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many varieties of meditation practices that have been developed and practiced for centuries around the world and adapted to Western culture. Many of these include breathwork or a focusing on physical sensations in the body, while others use chanting or mental 'mantras' that might involve the repetition of positive affirmations, words, or sounds. Most communities offer free or nearly-free meditation classes or open group meditation offerings for people interested in trying this in a supportive environment.  Meditation or mindfulness are not associated with any particular religion and can be practiced by any person, regardless of religion, culture, or life philosophy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Try This: Breathwork</h4>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In and Out</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>(Inbreath ((I am)) and outbreath ((at peace)).

The BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes are probably the most well-known genes that can increase a person's risk of developing cancer.  These genes are mostly associated with breast and ovarian cancers, though they can also increase the risk of other cancers such as pancreatic as well.  Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is another well-known, but relatively rare inherited condition that can predispose carriers to gastrointestinal cancers like colon cancer.  People that carry these genes are not certain to get cancer, but it is important to be aware of the risk to ensure that cancer screening is started early, to be even more vigilant about lifestyle and healthy habits, and to talk with a genetic counselor, trusted oncologist or other medical provider to determine how to best reduce risks.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most people don't qualify or wouldn't benefit from genetic testing for cancer, but to explore this more fully, see our resource section.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\t\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"petrucelli23\" hint=\"Petrucelli, 2023\" />\r\n\t</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "63697", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00167","name":"Healthy Person with Cancer","create_date":"2025-03-10","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Emotional Health"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>A Healthy Person with Cancer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, people who have enjoyed good health can get cancer. And that’s because cancer is a complex multi-factorial illness. Even when you focus on eating a healthy diet and exercising, there are things out of your control like genetics and environmental factors. And, some cancers arise simply from genetic accidents during cell division. Unfortunately, coming to terms with cancer can be even more challenging if you were experiencing life as a healthy person prior to your diagnosis. For someone who was previously healthy, having cancer can heighten the emotional impact by adding feelings of shock, disbelief, and anger. A healthy person may even feel as if their body betrayed them. These emotions can be intense and are often combined with the typical feelings of sadness, anxiety, and uncertainty that can accompany a cancer diagnosis. For healthy individuals, this can lead to feelings of isolation as they struggle to find other people who truly understand how they feel. It’s important to remind yourself that going through a variety of emotions is a normal part of the cancer journey even when you are a healthy person with cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Supporting your emotional health as a healthy person with cancer is important because research shows that emotional support is associated with improved outcomes and better overall wellness. It has been shown that partners, caregivers, and family members provide an important source of support so reach out to those individuals. However, friends, \r\n<a href=\"/cancertoolkit/cbt.html\" target=\"_blank\">healthcare professionals</a>, \r\n<a href=\"/cancertoolkit/2_community_resources.html\" target=\"_blank\" >community resources</a>, and \r\n<a href=\"/cancertoolkit/support_groups.html\" target=\"_blank\" >support groups</a> can help fill in any gaps. If you’re feeling intense emotions associated with being a healthy person with cancer, be proactive in embracing and processing your feelings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The good news is that if you enjoyed good health prior to your diagnosis, you are not alone. People in good health develop cancer more often than you may think. Plus, the healthier you are&mdash;even with cancer&mdash;the better you will tolerate and benefit from your treatments and optimize your recovery. The bottom line is that it is always important to nurture your health, whether you have a diagnosis of cancer or not.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna> \r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"NIHNCI2023\" hint=\"National Cancer Institute 2023\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Taylor2023\" hint=\"Taylor, 2023\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123137", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00168","name":"Stress Management","create_date":"2025-03-10","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Lifestyle"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_ENV\" cat_name=\"Environmental Exposures\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Stress Management</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be difficult to control the amount of stress you are under especially when dealing with a cancer diagnosis.

Within the past decade, about 40 different new targeted therapies for 12 different cancers has been approved. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are proteins in the body that help control how cancer cells grow, divide, and spread. Targeting therapies are small molecule drugs, immunotherapy, or monoclonal antibodies that target cancer cells. There are tests that can help determine if a specific type of tumor will respond to these targeted therapies. The small molecule drugs target the inside of the cell while immunotherapy drugs use the body’s immune system to fight the cancer. The monoclonal antibodies can attack cancer along several pathways. These proteins can:</p> \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Attach to the outside of the cancer cell so it can be more easily potted by the immune system.</li>\r\n\t<li>Cause cancer cells to self-destruct.</li>\r\n\t<li>Directly kill the cancer cells.</li>\r\n\t<li>Deliver toxins into the cancer cells to kill them.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While these drugs have been shown to be effective, some cancer cells can become resistant to this therapy and there can be side effects.

If the disruption persists, there is an increased risk of a variety of negative health effects including obesity, mental health issues, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, and even cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's critical to keep circadian rhythm in sync and avoid disruption. Here are some things to focus on:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Establish a regular sleep-wake routine.</li>\r\n\t<li>Keep a consistent meal schedule.</li>\r\n\t<li>Create a consistent bedtime routine.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get regular physical activity.</li>\r\n\t<li>Avoid late afternoon naps.</li>\r\n\t<li>Limit caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, and some medicines close to bedtime.</li>\r\n\t<li>Get more sunlight during the day and limit artificial light before bed.</li>\r\n\t<li>Consider taking a melatonin supplement before bed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Melatonin is released as a part of a healthy circadian rhythm so disruption can cause a decline in melatonin production which can lead to poor sleep and other issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can’t get outside and spend at least 20 minutes a day in the sunlight, you may want to consider getting a light box and sitting in front of that a few times throughout your day. Light therapy can also help the body create more melatonin.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"NIHNIGMS23\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"NIH, 2023\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"zhou2022\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Zhou, 2022\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"NIH2022\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"NIH, 2022\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"Challet2024\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Challet, 2024\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123132", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00005","name":"Screening Tools","create_date":"2019-03-13","publish_date":"2018-04-11","related_docs":{},"categories":["The Basics"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_BASICS\" cat_name=\"The Basics\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Screening Tools</h2>\r\n<p>There are several cancer screening tools that are recommended for adults, depending on age and gender, such as mammograms, colonoscopy, PAP smears, or even lung cancer screen (in those with history of smoking).

It is a whole-body philosophy that started more than 5,000 years ago in India. In modern practice, there are many varieties and teaching styles, and people practice yoga for many different reasons.  One aim of yoga is to promote harmony between mind, body, and spirit to help you feel calmer, stronger, and more resilient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some forms of yoga are quite strenuous, while others are gentler and focus more on meditation and breath work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoga approaches for cancer patients can include physical postures, breathing practices, and meditation. The research regarding yoga and cancer continues to expand. Yoga was found to reduce fatigue and sleep disturbances as well as improve depression and anxiety symptoms in breast cancer patients. With patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy, yoga was found to reduce fatigue and improve physical functioning and general quality of life. In men who had received radiation therapy for prostate cancer, yoga therapy provided some improvement of urinary and sexual dysfunction. It may also improve cognitive function in cancer patients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yoga is generally safe, though postures and breathing exercises should be tailored to your needs, physical fitness level, and experience.  Not all people can do all yoga postures safely.  If your physical function is limited or you have injuries, heart or breathing problems, it is wise to work with a well-trained yoga teacher to help guide you in your yoga practice.  Many communities offer chair yoga classes for people with limited mobility, strength, or those who are at risk of falling. Additionally, most yoga postures can be safely and gently adapted to protect you from injury, respect your body’s current state of health and functioning, and to meet your personal physical and mind-body goals.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" ></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"28045199\"  /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"18821529\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"28940301\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"27404902\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"27019663\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"24590636\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"28721886\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"27590865\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"29064279\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"26621521\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"17597249\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"15616408\"/></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"20105062\"/></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "66152", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00060","name":"Aromatherapy","create_date":"2019-05-14","publish_date":"2019-05-14","related_docs":{},"categories":["Complementary Therapies"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_COMP\" cat_name=\"Complementary Therapies\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Aromatherapy</h2>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\t<p>According to the National Cancer Institute, <i>\"Aromatherapy is the use of essential oils from plants (flowers, herbs, or trees) as therapy to improve physical, mental, and spiritual well-being.&rdquo;</i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>For thousands of years, fragrance and aromatic plants have been used therapeutically. A French physician in 1928 coined the term <em>aromatherapy</em>.

It is used along with conventional cancer treatment to help improve quality of life and enhance overall survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Complex topic</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nutrition is a complex topic both in how it is researched and how people feel about nourishment. The science of nutrition is an evolution, not a revolution. Additionally, the way we eat, including food combinations, and time between meals, may play a role in how our bodies respond to the foods we eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Physical/Biological Affects</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Nutrition can affect the body’s biological environment at many levels including metabolism, inflammation, epigenetics (how lifestyle and our environment affect our genes), and microbiome (gut health). Cancerous tumors grow within areas of tissue which have undergone significant changes. These altered areas are called tumor microenvironments. Tumor microenvironments are characterized by disorderly and uncontrolled cell growth, inflammation, loss of immune control, increased blood vessels, changes in how cells utilize glucose to make energy, and hypoxia (low oxygen). All these alterations, known as the hallmarks of cancer, can be influenced by lifestyle, including diet. One way to think about nutrition and cancer is to consider that every food contains many compounds which act as information for our cells. Over time, the food (information) that we provide our tissues can change components of the tumor microenvironment in ways that make it harder (or easier) for tumors to grow. If you're curious about these biological processes, we've provided some resources to explore.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64067", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00062","name":"Traditional Medicine/Whole Systems","create_date":"2019-05-14","publish_date":"2019-05-14","related_docs":{},"categories":["Complementary Therapies"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_COMP\" cat_name=\"Complementary Therapies\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Traditional Medicine/Whole Systems</h2>\r\n<h3>Defining Whole Person Health</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, whole person health involves looking at the whole person—not just separate organs or body systems—and considering multiple factors that promote either health or disease. Many of the medical systems that focus on whole person health are vibrant traditional systems of medicine practiced by cultures throughout the world. Examples of major Eastern whole medical systems include traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda. Whole medical systems of the West include homeopathy and naturopathy. Other systems have also been developed by Native American, African, Middle Eastern, Tibetan, and Central and South American cultures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While whole medical systems differ in their philosophical approaches to the prevention and treatment of disease, most share a common element: the belief that the body has inherent power to heal through engagement of mind, body, and spirit. Approaches to whole person health encompass philosophical models for optimization of health, individualized treatment programs, and use of specific therapies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While integrative medicine is not considered a whole medical system like the other traditional systems mentioned, it has quickly become a critical subspeciality within oncology that utilizes therapies from the other whole medical systems. There has been an important shift in cancer care with both patients and providers wanting a more comprehensive, individualized approach to treatment and survivorship. Integrative oncology fills that need.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" \r\n\t\tborderFragment=\"topicCards\" category=\"CANTK_WHOLE\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"NCCIH2021\" hint=\"National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, 2021\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "on", "main_image": "65086", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00173","name":"Importance of Social Support","create_date":"2025-03-12","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Emotional Health"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Importance of Social Support</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Helen Keller once famously said “walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light.” Social support is critical when it comes to healing from cancer, but it is also important to obtaining and maintaining better overall health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research is clear that social isolation and loneliness are associated with poor health outcomes including chronic pain, chronic illnesses, poor brain function, and pre-mature death. In fact, the World Health Organization puts social isolation in the same category as other major health risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that about 1 in 3 Americans feel lonely and 1 in 4 feel they have no social or emotional support. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is such a huge issue that the US Surgeon General sounded the alarm in 2023 by stating, “Our epidemic of loneliness and isolation has been an underappreciated public health crisis that has harmed individual and societal health. Our relationships are a source of healing and well-being hiding in plain sight – one that can help us live healthier, more fulfilled, and more productive lives,” said Dr. Vivek Murthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel you need to find ways to enhance your social support, consider the following tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Proactively reach out to family and friends and make time to see people on a regular basis.</li>\r\n<li>Be a good listener and offer your support/help when it may be needed.</li>\r\n<li>Consider joining a <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/support_groups.html\">support group</a> or becoming a volunteer with an organization that you care about.</li>\r\n<li>Consider <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/cbt.html\">counseling</a> or attending therapy sessions.</li>\r\n<li>Reach out to neighbors or other groups to expand your friend network.</li>\r\n<li>Maybe take a class or join a club to meet new people.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Being socially isolated or feeling lonely is not only uncomfortable, but it can also be damaging to health.

Reducing exposure involves toxin <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/avoidance.html\">avoidance</a>, looking at <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/indoor_air.html\">air</a> and <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/clean_water.html\">water quality</a>, eating <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/clean_food.html\">clean food</a>, reducing use of <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/plastics.html\">plastics</a>, and using safe <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/home_products.html\">home</a> and body <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/body_products.html\">products</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a lifestyle standpoint, physical activity and/or saunas are a great way to support detoxification as both encourage the elimination of toxins via sweat. Some foods and/or dietary supplement ingredients that can help support efficient detoxification include cruciferous vegetables, green tea, resveratrol (grapes, wine, peanuts), quercetin (apples, blueberries, onions, kale), and grapefruit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The liver is considered the master organ of detoxification so it’s important to support liver function through diet and potentially dietary supplements. A whole food, organic, plant-based-diet that features a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and phytonutrients will help support liver health and detoxification in general. Some herbs that help support liver health include milk thistle extract, artichoke, Oregon grape root, burdock root, and dandelion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are going through active treatment, talk to your oncologist or integrative practitioner before embarking on a dietary supplement program for detoxification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it’s true that harmful toxins can be found in food, air, water, and products we use daily, it’s also true that you have an innate detoxification system brilliantly designed to help reduce the burden of these chemicals. That’s why supporting detoxification through diet, lifestyle, and possibly dietary supplements is so critical.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entrytype=\"NORMAL\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\" entryid=\"26167297\" hint=\"Hodges, 2015\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entrytype=\"NORMAL\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\" entryid=\"Panda2023\" hint=\"Panda, 2023\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entrytype=\"NORMAL\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\" entryid=\"Jung2020\" hint=\"Jung, 2020\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123145", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00175","name":"Enhancing Authenticity","create_date":"2025-03-12","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Care of the Spirit"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Enhancing Authenticity</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To be authentic is to express one’s true nature in a genuine, trustworthy manner. Authenticity is being true to your values and having congruence between your actions and your words. Keep in mind that the opposite of congruence is defensiveness so reducing defensiveness will encourage more authenticity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Authentic people tend to be transparent, clear communicators, and take responsibility for their actions. Authentic people also believe their life has meaning which is positively correlated with enhanced psychological and physical health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research demonstrates that living and being authentic is associated with a wide variety of positive health effects including higher levels of self-esteem, overall psychological well-being, positivity, optimism, and relationship quality.\r\nThe first step towards enhancing authenticity is understanding and embracing your values and beliefs. You may even want to do some journaling or make a short list of your core beliefs and what you value most. From there, it’s essential to live in alignment with those values and beliefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being mindful and consistently participating in <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/CANTK_MEDMIND.html\">mind-body therapies</a> and <a href=\"/cancertoolkit/contemplative_practices.html\">contemplative practices</a> will also help encourage congruence and authenticity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s also important to communicate with clarity and honesty while being gentle with your opinions. Embracing vulnerability while establishing and maintaining boundaries is a big part of living an authentic life. Be a good listener and seek feedback. Trust your intuition while having compassion for others. Most of all, love yourself. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entrytype=\"NORMAL\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\" entryid=\"31388595\" hint=\"Wilt, 2019\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entrytype=\"NORMAL\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\" entryid=\"Wilt2021\" hint=\"Wilt, 2021\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entrytype=\"NORMAL\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\" entryid=\"ToperA2024\" hint=\"Toper A, 2024\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123133", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00177","name":"How About Some House Plants","create_date":"2025-03-12","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{},"categories":["Environmental Exposures"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How About Some House Plants</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Way back in 1989, NASA discovered that common household plants could detoxify indoor air by absorbing and removing harmful chemicals. Since that time, research has confirmed that plants do help improve indoor air quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a 2020 review found that the primary effect on indoor air quality included reduced pollutant levels particularly formaldehyde, benzene, and toluene. Formaldehyde is a toxin commonly used in household products such as plywood, glues, insulation, some cosmetics, and other products. Benzene can be found in paint, cleaning products, and vehicle/industrial emissions. Toluene is used in oil refining and the manufacturing of paint, lacquers, and glues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These chemicals found in building materials, furnishings, carpet, and other household items are known as Volatile Organic Compounds or VOCs and they are responsible for much of indoor air pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a variety of indoor plants to choose from that are easy to care for and lovely to look at. To see NASA’s recommendations, refer to the resource at the end of this section. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s worth noting that while house plants do help clean indoor air, they should not be used as a substitute for air purifiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s also worth noting that research indicates that indoor house plants have many other important health benefits including increased creativity, productivity, energy, concentration, and memory, as well as reduced stress. Conversely, it has also been found that when plants are removed from workspaces, there is a significant decline in attention and productivity and an increase in perceived stress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indoor plants in hospital rooms have also been shown to improve health outcomes and enhance surgery recovery. </p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna borderfragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"32170619\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Han, 2020\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"Hahn2021\" entrytype=\"NORMAL\" hint=\"Hahn, 2021\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna entryid=\"19715461\" entrytype=\"PUBMED\" hint=\"Park, 2009\" name=\"referenceEntry\" type=\"Reference\"></ecs:dyna></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "123138", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00057","name":"First Oncology Appointment","create_date":"2019-05-07","publish_date":"2018-01-07","related_docs":{},"categories":["Navigating Cancer Care"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2><strong>Your First Oncology Appointment</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming and anxiety-provoking.

In supplement form, it is sometimes referred to as ubiquinol, which is the reduced form of CoQ10. CoQ10 has been found to be useful for several medical conditions including heart failure, chronic fatigue, and weakened immune system, among many other conditions. In cancer, CoQ10 may help protect the heart from damage that can be caused by some chemotherapy drugs such as Adriamycin. CoQ10 may also be beneficial for cancer-related fatigue. It is an antioxidant and may also have some anti-cancer properties. People with very low levels of CoQ10 may be predisposed to certain types of cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dose</h3>\r\n<p>At a dose of 100 mg three times daily, CoQ10 has been shown to improve cancer-related fatigue in breast cancer patients. When supplementing with CoQ10, 100-300 mg daily is considered to be the most effective dosage range.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n<p>Coenzyme Q10 is generally considered to be safe and well-tolerated. Rarely, it can result in gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort. CoQ10 can decrease blood pressure so for patients taking blood pressure medications, careful monitoring is advised.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\t\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"NIHNCI24\" hint=\"National Cancer Institute 2024\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65345", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00068","name":"Mood and Emotion","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-01","related_docs":{},"categories":["Emotional Health"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_EMOHEALTH\" cat_name=\"Emotional Health\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Mood &amp; Emotions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Receiving a cancer diagnosis can be an intensely emotional experience. These emotions cycle in different ways for different individuals and can range from terror to anger, guilt to shame, despair or sadness, and feeling emotionally numb. Anxiety can be high because of the fears of the unknown, feelings of threat to life, worry about yourself, the treatment, loved ones, family, and more. Cancer can also trigger previous traumas or grief or feel like a PTSD experience from the diagnosis itself. It is essential to find ways to safely process these intense emotions as they come up in a healthy and nurturing way. Often, cancer will also provide an opportunity for a life review, clarifying life's purpose, exploring the quality of relationships, and may make you more keenly aware of who you are and what you need, allowing a deeper focus on your true authentic self. Surprisingly, some people even feel a deep sense of calm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anxiety and depression are common in cancer patients. It is not surprising that getting a cancer diagnosis provokes these changes in mood. Anxiety in cancer patients is not always identified or treated in a medical setting. It's important for you to share the feelings you are experiencing and ask for help if you are experiencing heightened depression and/or anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unaddressed negative emotions precipitate a physical stress response that can impact prognosis negatively as well as interfere with relationships and experiencing joy in your life. Identifying your feelings and working with them takes time but is rewarded by freedom as you reconstruct your life and find your new normal. Who is the \"New You\"? Searching for ways to improve mood and promote emotional wellness should be an ongoing process and an important part of treatment goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Fatigue-Pain-Depression Cycle</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Cancer related fatigue affects 80% to 90% of people undergoing cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation and overall affects 40% of all people diagnosed with cancer. Even after treatment and remission, as many as 30% may have ongoing fatigue. Depression is also a frequent concurrent problem when fatigue is unresolved and impacts quality of life. Poor sleep can promote fatigue, worsening depression as well as chronic pain. It is difficult to be in a good mood when there is pain or significant fatigue, a cycle that can impact quality of life. Conversely, feeling depressed can promote fatigue and worsen pain. It is important to rule out reversible causes such as medication side effects, hypothyroidism, anemia, organ dysfunction (e.g., heart failure, pulmonary issues), poor sleep quality, pain, depression, or menopausal symptoms. After addressing medical reasons for fatigue with a health care professional, there are still many ways of reducing fatigue and improving mood using integrative therapies. Regular physical activity has been shown to improve sleep, decrease fatigue, reduce depression, and improve chronic pain, thereby improving overall quality of life. It is the most effective treatment for the fatigue-pain-depression cycle. There are several additional lifestyle or integrative approaches to address these symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Integrative Approaches</h3>\r\n<p>Beyond using prescription medications for mood, there are many effective strategies that you can safely use to promote healing and vitality. The key is to choose one or more of these to enrich your life, make positive connections with others, and examine negative moods that affect your decision-making process and quality of life. Using integrative strategies builds hope, hardiness and resilience, and allows you to create a brighter and more healthy future.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"collapsibleInSet\" heading=\"Acupuncture\" first=\"yes\"><!--ACUPUNCTURE-->\r\n\t\t<h4>Acupuncture</h4>\r\n\t\t<p>Acupuncture is safe and useful for a variety of symptoms and health-related conditions.

Natural light has many benefits, including improving natural sleep by increasing your body's melatonin levels.</p>\r\n\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourceItems\" title=\"New York State: Dept. of Environmental Conservation: Immerse Yourself in a Forest for Better Health\" link=\"https://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/90720.html\" first=\"yes\" last=\"yes\">\r\n\t\t\tRead about the health benefits from immersing yourself in a forest.\r\n\t</ecs:dyna>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"collapsibleInSet\" heading=\"Counseling\"><!--COUNSELING-COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY-->\r\n\t<h4>Counseling</h4>\r\n\t<p>There are many types of therapy that can be useful along the cancer journey. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a \"problem-focused\" and \"action-oriented\" form of counseling that helps to identify thought distortions which results in anxious or depressed behaviors. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) uses mindfulness philosophies to help you just notice, accept, and embrace all of your emotions, including the negative ones. Cognitive-Based Compassion Therapy (CBCT) is a practice of increasing compassion for yourself and others through the development of a contemplative practice.</p>\r\n\t<p>Therapy is not generally a one-size-fits-all approach.  It can take time to find the right therapist or right approach to therapy, but it is worth the effort.  Many studies have confirmed that therapy or counseling, used by itself, or in combination with medications or other treatments, can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety.

It is a monounsaturated fat that is rich in a variety of nutrients, including polyphenols. These polyphenols are powerful antioxidants and have other protective qualities as well. Evidence about the healthful qualities of olive oil continues to grow. There are now studies that link diets rich in extra virgin olive oil to protection against heart disease and some cancers such as breast, gastrointestinal, and urinary tract. Olive oil is a wonderful oil to be ingested along with a diet rich in vegetables and fruits. Every kitchen should be stocked with lots of high quality extra virgin olive oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Extra virgin olive oil is made from pure, cold-pressed olives and has higher concentrations of healthy phenols and other nutrients. Extra virgin olive oil is therefore preferred over more processed types of olive oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3> How to use it</h3>\r\n<p>When cooking, it&rsquo;s important to keep the temperature of olive oil low enough that it does not smoke. Over-heating oil leads to the production of toxic compounds.

Soy farming often uses lots of pesticides, so it may be preferable to purchase organic soy when you can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soy foods may be protective against hormonal cancers such as breast, endometrial, or prostate cancers. Soy contains isoflavones that are known as phytoestrogens, which means that they bind to estrogen receptors in cells throughout the body. Because of this, in the past, breast cancer patients were told to avoid eating soy foods. Extensive evaluation and study have shown that not only are whole soy foods not dangerous for breast cancer patients, they can be protective. This appears to be because when soy binds to an estrogen receptor it reduces its activity instead of stimulating it like estrogen does. The protection from breast cancer is best studied in women or girls who eat more soy foods as young women or adolescents. However, even in adults, consuming soy foods is associated with reduced risk of breast cancer. Soy also provides fiber and other compounds called flavonoids which have multiple anti-cancer effects. Overall, soy intake is associated with reduced risk of colon cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, uterine cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Avoid heavily processed soy foods</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Refrain from eating heavily processed soy-based foods such as soy hotdogs and other artificial meats. These have not been found to be protective and are likely loaded with salt, artificial ingredients, and preservatives. The safety of soy protein isolates or textured vegetable protein, as well as soy protein powders, has also not been confirmed, so it is probably best to limit their intake. Eating soy in whole food forms can be healthful and delicious.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"35308286\" hint=\"Fan, 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64227", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00180","name":"Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals","create_date":"2025-03-12","publish_date":"2025-03-31","related_docs":{"TKR00222": 1, "TKR00223": 1},"categories":["Environmental Exposures"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The tissues and glands within the body’s endocrine system produce and release powerful hormones that either directly or indirectly influence nearly all aspects of your health including mood, metabolism, and more. That’s why it’s so important to protect this system from disruption. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, many chemicals are considered endocrine disruptors that can wreak havoc on this important system. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, when these chemicals disrupt endocrine function, there is an increased risk of developmental malformation and reproductive issues, as well as disturbances in immune and nervous system function. Many of these chemicals are also linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, especially hormone sensitive cancers such as breast and prostate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Understanding Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDCs are chemicals that are encountered daily that mimic, block, or interfere with normal hormone activity. This is a very sensitive system so any disruption can cause hormonal imbalances that can negatively impact health on many levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Endocrine Society reports that of the nearly 85,000 human-made chemicals worldwide, more than 1,000 are considered EDCs because of their unique make-up. These chemicals can be found in everyday products like cosmetics, food and beverage packaging, toys, carpets, pesticides, plastics, and more.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research has confirmed that these chemicals can increase risk of some cancers. For example, dioxin and cadmium increase the risk of breast and thyroid cancer while arsenic and asbestos increase the risk of prostate cancer and organochlorines/organohalogens increase the risk of testicular cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reducing exposure is as much as possible is critical.

Advanced Care Planning is the process of making decisions about the medical care that you would like to receive if you are unable to speak for yourself. These are your decisions to make, based on your preferences and values. These preferences can be written down in a legal document called an advanced directive. This helps others know what type of medical care you would want. Communicating your desires with a loved one that you trust is also important. This person can be designated as your medical power of attorney (mPoA). The responsibility of this person is to ensure that your values and preferences are respected throughout your care. The legal document helps guide this process, but in times of crisis, the one you love will be the person advocating for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is recommended that all people, regardless of age or stage of illness, complete an advanced directive and communicate clearly with their loved one(s) about their wishes. Life is sometimes unpredictable, and therefore it is important to be prepared for any unexpected event. The goal is always to live the best life you can, at any given moment, in spite of this unpredictability.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourceItems\" title=\"National Cancer Institute: Advanced Directives\" link=\"https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/managing-care/advance-directives\" first=\"yes\" last=\"yes\">\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65942", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00061","name":"Massage Therapy","create_date":"2019-05-14","publish_date":"2019-05-14","related_docs":{},"categories":["Complementary Therapies"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_COMP\" cat_name=\"Complementary Therapies\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Massage Therapy</h2>\r\n\t\t<p>Massage is an ancient technique that spans many cultural and healing traditions.

Many types of chemotherapy result in temporary damage to taste buds, resulting in changes in flavor of familiar foods. For some, this results in a metallic, bitter, or other uncomfortable flavor. Others report changes in smell, so that the smell of the cooking of food will result in nausea, or the aroma of food is no longer appealing. These can result in appetite changes, leading to weight loss. Surgery and radiation therapy, as well as the cancer itself, can also lead to changes in taste, smell and appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is imperative to discuss changes in taste, smell, appetite, or your weight with your oncologist or other health care provider, and possibly with a certified oncology dietician as well. Mouth pain, oral ulcers (mouth sores), discomfort with swallowing, constipation, medications, or a variety of other causes can also read to changes in appetite and possibly weight loss. These conditions should be treated or addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to take excellent care of your mouth and teeth during all phases of cancer and cancer treatment. Oral health is a critical component of whole health. If using traditional toothpaste burns or is uncomfortable, you can change flavors, or make your own using coconut oil and baking soda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Put a toothpaste amount of coconut oil onto your toothpaste, then dip into a small jar or bowl of baking soda, wet slightly and brush normally.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"subNavPanel\" href=\"/cancertoolkit/nutrition.html\" subname=\"Nutrition\" category=\"CANTK_NUT\"></ecs:dyna>", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": null, "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": "<a href=\"#navPanel\" data-icon=\"bars\" data-iconpos=\"notext\">Menu</a>"}},{"document_id":"TKC00015","name":"Anti-Cancer Super Foods","create_date":"2019-03-25","publish_date":"2018-06-04","related_docs":{},"categories":["Lifestyle"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_LIFE\" cat_name=\"Lifestyle\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Anti-Cancer Super Foods</h2>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"pagesList\" category=\"CANTK_SUPERFOOD\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"subNavPanel\" href=\"/cancertoolkit/CANTK_LIFE.html\" subname=\"Lifestyle\" category=\"CANTK_LIFE\" />", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "on", "main_image": "65052", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": "<a href=\"#navPanel\" data-icon=\"bars\" data-iconpos=\"notext\">Menu</a>"}},{"document_id":"TKC00012","name":"Trusted Guidance","create_date":"2019-03-14","publish_date":"2019-03-14","related_docs":{},"categories":[],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Trusted Guidance</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Supplements and botanicals have a potential to interact with chemotherapy or other medical treatments, sometimes increasing the toxicity of the treatment, and other times decreasing the effectiveness.

According to the National Cancer Institute, &ldquo;At its most basic, cancer is a disease of he genes in the cells of our body... changes to these genes can cause cells to malfunction, causing them to grow and divide when they should not&mdash;or preventing them from dying when they should. These abnormal cells can become cancer&rdquo;.

Most cancers arise from changes in genetic structures that occur during a person&#39;s lifetime. These changes can take place at the core DNA level (genetic), or they can affect the way the DNA is expressed, resulting in epigenetic changes that can be either protective or harmful, depending on what is driving that change. There are many environmental exposures, foods, and other lifestyle behaviors that can affect epigenetic changes to DNA, leading to biologic changes in the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Behavior Changes</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It is estimated that up to 50% of adult cancer diagnoses are related to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. According to the American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR), lifestyle changes that can promote cancer include cigarette smoking, drug and alcohol use, radiation exposure, excess body weight and obesity, consummation of red and processed meat, consumption of processed foods, low consumption of vegetables and fruits, low dietary calcium, and physical inactivity. Environmental and chemical exposures can also increase cancer risk, as can certain occupational exposures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Environmental Toxins</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that there are over 40 chemicals found in the workplace that are listed as occupational carcinogens (cancer promoting). Additionally, there are several known infectious agents that contribute to about 12% of cancers worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"canepig24\" hint=\"Yu, 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"30806885\" hint=\"Park, 2019\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"AICR50\" hint=\"AICR, 2019\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"WHOcance\" hint=\"WHO, 2019\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64642", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00122","name":"Ginger","create_date":"2019-06-06","publish_date":"2019-06-06","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Ginger</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to its long history of use as a spice, references to ginger as a medicinal agent can be found in ancient Chinese, Indian, Arabic, and Greco-Roman texts. Ginger has been used for a variety of conditions, but it is chiefly known as an antinausea, anti-inflammatory, digestive aid, diaphoretic (induces perspiration), and warming agent. Numerous studies have shown it is an effective at reducing nausea and vomiting with pregnancy. A smaller number of studies have looked at its possible role in alleviating chemotherapy-induced nausea. Ginger may also improve appetite in people with loss of appetite and cancer cachexia, a wasting syndrome associated with significant loss of muscle and weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ginger may also contribute to a reduced risk of cancer because it has anti-inflammatory and direct anti-cancer actions in a variety of cancer types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that in the marketplace, many ginger products contain concentrated ginger extracts, which can worsen nausea and vomiting.

In cancer, glutamine has been used to help protect mucous membranes and therefore is used to treat or prevent mouth sores (mucositis) or intestinal damage from chemotherapy. It is also used to protect peripheral nerves from chemotherapy with the hope of reducing peripheral neuropathy (damage to sensory nerves that results in numbness, tingling and/or pain).</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Usage and Dose</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Glutamine is found in powder or capsule forms. It can be used in doses of 3 grams, three times daily. It has been used with zinc supplementation to help treat chemotherapy mouth sores (mucositis) and has been used to help protect nerves from chemotherapy-related damage known as peripheral neuropathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Glutamine is generally well-tolerated, though there are theoretical concerns about its use in cancer. This is because glutamine is abundant in the human body and serves as fuel for cancer cells. Although clinical trials have not shown that glutamine supplementation increases tumor growth, it remains a hypothetical concern. Therefore, use of glutamine should only be done under the guidance of a trusted integrative oncology provider during active cancer treatment. Glutamine should not be taken during paclitaxel (Taxol and Abraxane) and docetaxel (Taxotere) chemotherapy as it may increase the risk of peripheral neuropathy.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"32512833\" hint=\"Anderson, 2020\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65346", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00088","name":"Radiation","create_date":"2019-05-22","publish_date":"2019-05-22","related_docs":{},"categories":["Navigating Cancer Care"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h3>During Radiation Therapy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiation is often used either alone, or in combination with other cancer therapies (like surgery or chemotherapy).  Radiation therapy works in part by creating free radicals, causing DNA damage in cancer cells. Many vitamins and supplements work as antioxidants, and it is unknown whether specific supplements or antioxidant treatments interfere with the formation of free radicals. Antioxidants in foods are safe and likely beneficial, but you may be advised to stop taking herbal and vitamin supplements during the course of radiation treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Radiation treatment is temporary.

The disease might be controlled or stabilized with appropriate treatments, allowing for periodic breaks from conventional treatment. In this way, cancer care is not always a sprint to the finish. Some survivors, including many with advanced or stage IV cancers, approach cancer care more as a marathon, living with cancer as a chronic illness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note that the definition of cancer survivorship includes family members, friends, and caregivers, since they are also impacted by the diagnosis and experience.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"nihncisur\" hint=\"NCI, 2024\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "63700", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00049","name":"Clean Water","create_date":"2019-04-30","publish_date":"2019-05-01","related_docs":{},"categories":["Environmental Exposures"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_ENV\" cat_name=\"Environmental Exposures\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Clean Water</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The water we drink, cook, or bathe with is susceptible to pollution from numerous industries, including the military, agricultural runoff, firefighting foams, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, improper hazardous chemical disposal, or naturally occurring substances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most Americans receive their drinking water from municipal water systems which are regulated by the Safe Water Drinking Act (SWDA), which sets regulations for approximately 90 different contaminants.

The consumption of more than 18 ounces per week of red meat has been shown to increase colorectal cancer risk. This is equivalent to approximately 2.25 half-pound (8 oz) steaks or burgers per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the temperature at which meat, including fish, poultry, and red meat, is cooked, makes a difference. When meat is cooked at high temperatures, such as grilling or charring, a toxic compound called heterocyclic amine (HCA) amine is formed. HCAs have been found, in animal studies, to lead to the development of breast, colon, liver, skin, prostate, and other cancers. Additionally, when the fat or juices from meat on the grill drip onto the flames, or when meat is smoked, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are formed. PAHs are also known cancer-causing chemicals that can promote DNA damage, leading to increased cancer risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, marinating meat in olive oil with added spices, onion and garlic prior to grilling reduces the formation of HCAs. Also, grilling at the lowest possible temperature and avoiding long cooking times needed for well-done meat will reduce HCA formation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Processed and cured meats should also be avoided. Processed meat refers to the processes of curing, fermenting, smoking, or otherwise preserving the meat. Curing meats with nitrite and smoking meats produce cancer-causing compounds in the meat. Examples of processed meats include hot dogs, ham, bacon, sausages, corned beef, lunchmeats, beef jerky, canned meat, and meat-based preparations and sauces. Processed meats have consistently been associated with the risk of colorectal cancer. Salt-cured meats in Asia are associated with higher rates of gastric (stomach) cancer. Increased processed meat consumption has also been associated with greater risk of ovarian, breast, lung, rectal, liver, and endometrial cancers.</p>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"26779313\" hint=\"Aykan, 2015\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34455534\" hint=\"Farvid, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65140", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00058","name":"Community Resources","create_date":"2019-05-07","publish_date":"2019-05-06","related_docs":{},"categories":["Emotional Health", "Navigating Cancer Care"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Community Resources</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>With a cancer diagnosis and treatment, difficulties related to employment, school, relationships, family dynamics, or financial stability may compound the emotional, mental, and physical challenges of the disease.

Naturopathic doctors focus on patient education, prevention, lifestyle-based strategies, and natural therapies. A core principle of naturopathic medicine is the healing power of nature. This principle emphasizes the understanding that each person has inherent healing capacities. Naturopathic doctors support this innate healing power by using the most natural, least harmful means possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Naturopathic doctors (NDs) can be a key member of an individual&rsquo;s cancer care team. They provide guidance in safe and effective ways to improve tolerance to conventional treatments, reduce risk of cancer and its recurrence, and to optimize survivorship. NDs utilize strategies that may include nutrition, dietary supplements, homeopathy, intravenous therapies, and mind-body medicine. Ideally, naturopathic doctors work collaboratively with conventional providers throughout the continuum of cancer, from prevention, through treatment, and into survivorship.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Education and Specialization</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Always seek naturopathic care from a naturopathic doctor who has received their training from a Federally recognized and regionally <a href=\"https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-schools/\" target=\"_blank\">accredited school</a>.

What these eating patterns have in common is an emphasis on significantly decreasing carbohydrate intake in favor of increased fat and protein intake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Animal studies show that the ketogenic diet has anti-cancer benefits. This has not been well-replicated in humans, but there are several published case reports that demonstrate improvement, especially in brain tumors and breast tumors. More studies are needed to confirm the anti-cancer effects in humans.  The ketogenic diet relies on fat as the main source of calories, with some protein and extremely low amounts of carbohydrates. When a ketogenic diet is used to try to control cancer growth and development, it must also significantly reduce calories in order to force the body into a state of ketosis, which is metabolically similar to fasting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the ketogenic diet is generally considered safe, particularly when it is done under the supervision of a registered dietitian or other knowledgeable healthcare provider, there are concerns such as nutrient deficiencies, constipation, and cardiovascular issues. That’s why it is not routinely recommended for cancer patients. The ketogenic diet tends to be higher in animal proteins and fats, and increased animal fats, including excessive red meat, have been associated with an increased risk of breast and colon cancers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the ketogenic diet can be very low in fiber. Fiber is essential for gut health, and research is continually emerging about the importance of gut health, the microbiome. Poor gut health is also associated with a variety of chronic diseases including cancer. The ketogenic diet also does not supply sufficient B vitamins or vitamin D, so these need to be supplemented. Finally, this is a hard diet for many individuals to follow, limiting its potential value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel strongly about trying the ketogenic diet, or if it is recommended by your trusted medical provider, please see a qualified registered dietician (RD) for guidance. Many cancer centers have nutrition experts on their staff to help patients navigate the complicated world of specialized nutrition.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"jingli2021\" hint=\"Li 2021\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Alhamzah2023\" hint=\"Alhamzah 2023\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/cancerToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"subNavPanel\" href=\"/cancertoolkit/nutrition.html\" subname=\"Nutrition\" category=\"CANTK_NUT\"></ecs:dyna>", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65745", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00076","name":"Astragalus","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2>Astragalus</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Astragalus root has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine and is used for a variety of conditions.

For some it might also feel isolating and demoralizing. Yet people with cancer are not alone. More than 40% of American adults will be diagnosed with cancer in their lifetimes, which amounts to about more than two million new cancer diagnoses each year.<sup>1</sup> As staggering as these numbers may seem, cancer deaths continue to decline. Since 1991, the number of cancer deaths per year in the US has declined by 29%.<sup>2</sup> Many people diagnosed with cancer will survive beyond 5 years, and most will not die from this disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statistics don&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t define any of us. Maya Angelou puts it most eloquently:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:.5in;\"><em>&ldquo;My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style.

The tree nuts include walnuts, almonds, cashews, hazelnuts, pistachios, pecans and Brazil nuts. Peanuts come from the legume family and are not tree nuts. Nuts have been linked to longevity. A study of 130,000 people found that those who ate nuts every day were 20% less likely to die (of anything) during the 30 year study as compared to people who did not eat nuts. According to the authors, <a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/eating-nuts-linked-to-healthier-longer-life-201311206893\" target=\"_blank\">nuts may provide &ldquo;cardioprotective, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties</a>.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another <a href=\"https://news.yale.edu/2018/02/28/nut-consumption-may-aid-colon-cancer-survival\" target=\"_blank\">study followed over 800 stage III colon cancer survivors</a> and found that eating a handful of tree nuts per day resulted in 42% increase in cancer-free survival and 57% increase in overall survival. A large analysis of 33 studies that included more than 50,000 cancer cases also found that eating nuts helped reduce the risk of cancer especially against cancers of the digestive system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nuts are rich in fiber, healthy fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. All the tree nuts such as walnuts, almonds, and pecans seem to have healthful properties and can be enjoyed together or in rotation. Brazil nuts in particular are rich in the cancer-fighting antioxidant selenium. Limit Brazil nut intake to 2-3 per day, to avoid selenium toxicity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nuts are great mixed with meals, or eaten with fruit or alone as a snack. They are filling due to the fiber, fat and protein content. People who eat nuts regularly also tend to weigh less than those who don&rsquo;t consume nuts.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Bao2013\" hint=\"Bao,2013\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Fadelu2018\" hint=\"Fadelu, 2018\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Long20\" hint=\"Long, 2020\" /></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64228", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00001","name":"Cancer Treatment","create_date":"2019-03-11","publish_date":"2018-06-11","related_docs":{},"categories":["The Basics"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_BASICS\" cat_name=\"The Basics\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Cancer Treatment</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to begin to understand options for cancer treatment is to meet with a trusted oncologist in the community, at a reputable cancer center.   Options for cancer treatment are as varied as the many different types of cancer. Even within the same organ or tissue, cancers can vary in cell type and aggressiveness.  A biopsy is when tissue or cells are removed for examination and is often needed to guide treatment.  Sometimes watchful waiting (before starting treatment) is recommended for very slow growing cancers like low-risk prostate cancer or certain chronic leukemia conditions.  More commonly, treatments will be individualized and can include any combination of hormonal therapy, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or targeted therapy, among others.  Goals of care can include both quantity and quality of life.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is reasonable to seek a second opinion with a different provider or institution.  Oncology, like all of medicine, is a science and an art, with some very standardized treatment protocols, and other treatment plans that are tailored or individualized.  It is important to feel comfortable and confident in your oncology team and the treatment options offered.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are unsure how to find a reputable cancer center, the following resources may help: </p>\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\t\t<p>Please note that there may be reputable centers not reflected in the links above.

Luckily, there are many mind-body tools such as guided imagery or medical hypnosis recordings available for free or for sale online. These can be listened to daily in the weeks preceding surgery and perhaps even in the first days of recovery. If a particular recording makes you uncomfortable or isn&rsquo;t comforting, consider trying a different one, as there are different styles or voices that suit different people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mind-body tools like breath work, guided imagery, and relaxation practices can be useful after surgery, to aid your recovery, reduce pain, improve sleep, and decrease anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourceItems\" title=\"Kaiser Permanente: Guided Imagery Audios by Belleruth Naparstek\" link=\"https://thrive.kaiserpermanente.org/care-near-you/northern-california/eastbay/departments/perioperative-medicine/guided-imagery-podcasts/\" first=\"yes\" last=\"yes\">\r\n\tListen to these guided imagery podcasts for free.

The human body can make vitamin D3 when the skin is exposed to sunlight. Vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, is then converted in the liver to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D and ultimately converted to the active form of vitamin D in the kidneys. Vitamin D increases intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus which are used to preserve bone density. Vitamin D is also needed by nerves, muscles, and immune cells. Vitamin D helps to maintain blood sugar balance and adequate levels help minimize inflammation and pain. Vitamin D supplementation may reduce musculoskeletal and nerve-related pain associated with conventional cancer treatments. Finally, adequate vitamin D is associated with reduced cancer death.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Vitamin D in Food</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin D3 is found in fatty fish, and to a lesser degree cheese, egg yolks, and beef liver.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Deficiency</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An estimated 1/3 of the global population and 18% of the US population is deficient in vitamin D. You can ask your healthcare provider to check for vitamin D deficiency. If your vitamin D levels are low, supplementation with vitamin D3 can bring your vitamin D level to sufficiency. Be sure to discuss optimal vitamin D supplementation with your integrative provider or oncologist.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Because vitamin D is fat soluble, taking too much of it may cause it to accumulate in tissues and, although rare, may cause dangerously high levels of calcium, heart arrhythmias, and kidney damage. It is always best to have your blood level of vitamin D checked during supplementation to make sure that you are taking the correct dose.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"24918818\" hint=\"Keum, 2014\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34353470\" hint=\"Johnson, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"34248925\" hint=\"Oh, 2021\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"NIHVitD\" hint=\"National Institutes of Health 2024\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "91846", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00107","name":"5HTP","create_date":"2019-05-23","publish_date":"2019-05-23","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2>5HTP</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>For Mood and Sleep</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>5HTP is a botanical product that is derived from the seed of the plant <em>Griffonia simplicifolia</em>. It is often used for its positive effects on mood and sleep because it promotes the formation of serotonin and melatonin in the body. 5HTP may also improve chronic pain symptoms in patients with conditions such as fibromyalgia.  Because it can decrease appetite, it is sometimes used for weight loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Doses</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>5HTP is usually taken at a dose of 100 mg, 2–3 times daily. When used in the short term, 5HTP can be very effective, though some studies show that using it for long periods can diminish its effectiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Because 5HTP can increase serotonin levels, at very large doses it can lead to a life-threatening condition called serotonin syndrome. When used at appropriate doses, it is generally safe. Many medications, including anti-depressants and some sleep aids, also increase serotonin, which could lead to dangerous or even life-threatening levels. Certain nutritional supplements, such as SAM-E, also increase serotonin levels. 5HTP can also interfere with the metabolism of many pharmaceutical medications. If you are taking anti-depressants, sleeping aids, certain pain medications such as Tramadol, or dietary supplements, please consult a trusted integrative medical provider or pharmacist to ensure safety before starting 5HTP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common side effects include gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort and decreased appetite.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"33375373\" hint=\"Maffei, 2020\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65348", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00075","name":"Body Image","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-03","related_docs":{},"categories":["Emotional Health"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_EMOHEALTH\" cat_name=\"Emotional Health\" />\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Body Image &amp; Identity</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cancer itself, in addition to cancer treatment, can affect one's perception of identity. Chemotherapy or radiation related side effects may cause skin changes or hair loss. Surgical removal of cancerous areas may affect parts of you that impact self-image or esteem. Being exhausted and weight loss or gain from treatment may alter self-perception of health and vitality. Functional physical changes can impact self-esteem and intimate relationships during treatment. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Body image and identity issues are often an under-appreciated component of cancer and cancer treatment, and many patients feel embarrassed to bring them up to their healthcare providers. Yet, our relationship with our body and our functionality are core parts of our identity in many ways, and when they change, it can be difficult to accept and cope with. This is normal and should be addressed in a supportive and nurturing way, as many of these changes are beyond your control. These issues are recognized as real side effects of the cancer journey and addressing them are an important part of healing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Health providers such as psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and oncology nurses can provide specialized care in coping with emotional, spiritual, or physical issues that arise from alteration in body image or function. There are also resources available through local or national organizations to help you cope with sexuality issues and feelings of demoralization. There are also products such as wigs, specialized bras, bathing suits, and  items to help with incontinence or other body issues that may arise. Be sure to ask about these resources and products, because in the busy activity of caring for cancer patients, your healthcare team may forget to bring them up to you.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_BODIMG\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Finger18\" hint=\"Fingeret, 2018\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"29688834\" hint=\"Sherman, 2018\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65184", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00018","name":"Cruciferous Vegetables","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Super Foods"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Cruciferous Vegetables</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruciferous vegetables are a family of vegetables that include broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, radishes, turnips, and several dark leafy vegetables such as kale, and collard greens, to name a few. They are rich in many important vitamins including vitamin C, vitamin K (especially the dark leafy greens), B vitamins, and manganese. Cruciferous vegetables also contain plant chemicals called glucosinolates, many of which have been found to be beneficial. Also found in cruciferous vegetables is an enzyme, myrosinase. Myrosinase acts upon the glucosinolates to produce indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and sulforaphane, which create anti-cancer actions in the body. These nutrients are protective against cancer in several ways, including slowing the growth of cancer cells and helping to repair DNA. Myrosinase is critical to unleashing the health benefits of cruciferous vegetables, and it can be destroyed when exposed to high heat for prolonged periods. This is why lightly steaming cruciferous vegetables is the healthiest method of cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruciferous vegetables are also high in fiber, which is essential for a healthy gut microbiome and can help reduce the risk of colon and other cancers. Aim for leafy greens or other cruciferous vegetables every day, or at least several servings per week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Special note on broccoli sprouts</strong>:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broccoli sprouts are baby broccoli plants. They are rich in myrosinase, which turns glucosinolates into the cancer-fighting nutrient sulforaphane. In fact, raw broccoli sprouts have more than 50 times the amount of sulforaphane than regular broccoli. Even more exciting is that eating broccoli sprouts together with mature broccoli seems to be more beneficial than either alone.</p>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"NIHNCI2012\" hint=\"National Cancer Institute 2012\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Ağagündüz22\" hint=\"Ağagündüz, 2022\" /></p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64231", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00112","name":"Support Groups","create_date":"2019-05-29","publish_date":"2019-05-05","related_docs":{},"categories":["Emotional Health"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"saveParamsToSession\" curr_cat=\"CANTK_EMOHEALTH\" cat_name=\"Emotional Health\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Support Groups</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is normal to experience physical, psychological, and emotional effects at diagnosis, throughout treatment, and after treatment.

Having a spiritual belief system or practice can be a part of a religion but does not have to be. Addressing spirituality has been found to reduce surgical complications, pain, length of hospital stay, and can improve physical functioning, quality of life, and psychological well-being. Spiritual struggles are related to poorer well-being, difficulties making goals or care decisions, as well as increased anxiety, depression, feelings of separation, and hopelessness. Creating spiritual community either within or outside of a religious context can generate a sense of purpose and meaning and improves quality of life for survivors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may want to create your own or join an existing group within a chosen place of worship, prayer circle, or meditation group. You can use Social Media to find existing groups for people diagnosed with cancer and cancer survivors in your area.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Spiritual Care Professionals</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For some, it might help to work with a spiritual care professional. This may be good for those who have spiritual struggles, as well as for those who wish to explore these ideas more deeply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are different names for spiritual care professionals. A few examples include:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>Clergy</strong> are leaders you&#39;ll find in many faiths.<br />\r\n<strong>Chaplains</strong> have special training to help people in many settings.

And yet, health care providers, as well as patients, are often uncomfortable having open discussions around this problem, which can lead to treatment delays or a diminished quality of life. It can be helpful to tell your healthcare provider about issues like body image concerns, vaginal dryness, erectile difficulties, relationship satisfaction, libido, and negative relationship issues that have come up. Your healthcare team likely has ways to help or can refer you to others with more expertise in these areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the difference between an intimacy issue and sexual function is important. Work with your medical team to alleviate physical symptoms that would impede intimacy. Journaling, art therapy, counseling, and mind-body modalities like hypnosis may be helpful in body image issues that may be impeding sexual intimacy or function. An important goal is to honor yourself as a desirable being, worthy of love. Working with your partner on confidence, intimacy and unconditional acceptance is key. Know that intimacy can be expressed in many ways and experiment with these in your relationship for optimal fulfillment. Seek professional support as needed.</p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"26716390\" hint=\"Bober, 2016\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"25916689\" hint=\"Boquiren, 2016\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"25040442\" hint=\"Gilbert, 2014\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"27240019\" hint=\"Wettergren, 2017\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65188", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00037","name":"Intermittent Fasting and Cancer","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Diets and Eating Patterns"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Intermittent Fasting and Cancer</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the past decade, there has been increased scientific interest in fasting and its relationship to chronic diseases, including cancer. There is emerging evidence that intermittent fasting has positive effects on metabolism, decreases cellular growth signaling pathways and reduces inflammation in the body. Different protocols for intermittent fasting have been developed, and it is still not clear which populations would benefit most from fasting, how long to fast, or how frequently. However, as the research continues to expand, many of those questions will likely be answered. Here's what we know now. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some patients report decreased side effects when they fast around chemotherapy infusions. Several small clinical trials have found that patients with a variety of cancer types experience fewer chemotherapy-related side-effects from fasting for several days before, during and/or after chemotherapy infusions. In addition, preliminary research demonstrates that fasting during treatment can improve prognosis. Intermittent fasting is also known as time-restricted feeding and there are three main types:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Alternate day fasting where you fast every other day </li>\r\n<li>5:2 fasting where you eat normally for five days and then choose two days to\r\nrestrict calories typically to about 500 per day</li>\r\n<li>Overnight fasting shortens the eating window to about ten hours which means\r\nthere is a 14 hour overnight fast</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There is some evidence that overnight fasting might reduce cancer recurrence rates in people with a history of breast cancer. Over 2000 patients with a history of breast cancer were followed for 11 years to evaluate their risk of breast cancer recurrence. Women who routinely fasted overnight for 13 hours or more had a reduced risk of breast cancer recurrence. For example, stopping eating or drinking (anything other than water or black tea or coffee) at 7 pm and not eating or drinking again until 8 am the next morning would be a 13 hour overnight fast. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>A clear protocol for how to fast, or for how long, has not been defined. In general, one to\r\nthree days of fasting around chemotherapy should only be attempted if you are not at\r\nrisk of losing weight, not underweight, not at risk of malnutrition or protein deficiency,\r\nare not elderly, are not taking medications for diabetes, and if your chemotherapy\r\ninfusions are spaced out at least 3 weeks apart. Ideally, it is best to discuss the risks\r\nand benefits of fasting and chemotherapy with a trusted health care provider or\r\nregistered oncology dietician who knows your medical history and is well-versed in the\r\ndifferent types of fasts.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"35848874\" hint=\"Tiwari, 2022\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"27032109\" hint=\"Marinac, 2016\" /></p>\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"Cienfuegos20\" hint=\"Cienfuegos 2020\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"subNavPanel\" href=\"/cancertoolkit/nutrition.html\" subname=\"Nutrition\" category=\"CANTK_NUT\"></ecs:dyna>", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65744", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00071","name":"Zinc","create_date":"2019-05-17","publish_date":"2019-05-17","related_docs":{},"categories":["Supplements and Botanicals"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\t\r\n<h2>Zinc</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Zinc plays an important role in immune system health, wound healing, and DNA repair. Zinc deficiency may even play a role in cancer development. Zinc supplementation can be beneficial in treating mouth sores that can be a side effect of cancer treatment, enhancing the sense of smell/taste, improving bone density, and helping fight infections such as the common cold.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Zinc in Food</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Zinc is found in a wide variety of foods. While oysters have the highest concentration of zinc, red meat and chicken are key sources in the American diet. Other foods rich in zinc  include legumes, nuts, whole grains, dairy products, and fortified-foods such as breakfast cereals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zinc from animal sources is absorbed better than the zinc from plant sources because phytates found in plant sources decrease zinc absorption.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Deficiency</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can ask your healthcare provider to check for a zinc deficiency. If your zinc levels are low, supplementation with elemental zinc is important to protect many body functions. Discuss optimal zinc supplementation with your integrative provider or oncologist. Some medications, such as some antacids, anti-seizure medicines, diuretics, and anti-inflammatory medications can decrease zinc levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Warnings</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Long-term zinc supplementation over 2 months at higher doses of > 50 mg per day can lead to copper deficiency. Copper is also an essential mineral for the body, and many zinc formulations have a small amount of added copper for this reason. Lab tests can help  monitor zinc and copper levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nasal zinc sprays are not recommended because they can lead to a loss of the sense of smell.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" \r\n\t\tborderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\" />\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"NORMAL\" entryId=\"NIHMag22\" hint=\"National Institutes of Health 2022\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65344", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00063","name":"Mind-Body Therapies","create_date":"2019-05-14","publish_date":"2019-05-15","related_docs":{},"categories":["Complementary Therapies", "Emotional Health"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n\r\n<h2>Mind-Body Therapies </h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mind-Body is a term that covers a broad range of modalities, from ancient mindfulness meditation to modern neurofeedback. The primary goal of mind-body therapies is to trigger a relaxation response, but they also help build up one’s resilience against stress. Throughout your lifetime your brain adapts and changes through experiences and training which is known as neuroplasticity. There is no question that receiving a cancer diagnosis can be stressful so trying mind-body techniques to help decrease stress and increase relaxation are likely to be beneficial. Mind-body approaches may enhance health in other ways as well, such as decreased pain, better digestion, improved sleep, and enhanced immunity. Many mind-body approaches stem from simply becoming aware of breath and being present. Practices that focus on breathing at their core can be still such as sitting meditations or they can involve movement such as walking meditation, Yoga, Tai Chi, or Qi Gong. Many organizations offer classes or structured activities to help teach and practice these approaches, including Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), among others. Other mind-body activities involve guided experiences such as medical hypnosis or guided imagery. Research continues to illustrate the positive impact mind-body activities can have on quality of life and psychological well-being in cancer patients. Many of these modalities also help with other common cancer-related symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatigue, and anxiety or fear of recurrence.</p>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"resourcesList\" category=\"CANTK_MINDBODY\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" \r\n\t\tborderFragment=\"pagesList\" list_heading=\"Mind-Body Moments\" category=\"CANTK_MBM\" />\r\n\r\n<h3>Explore Different Modalities</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Harnessing the mind-body connection activates powerful inner resources for healing and relaxation. Though the techniques may differ, the end goal of triggering the relaxation response is the primary aim and combining different modalities is fairly common. For example, imagery is often included as part of meditation and hypnosis; biofeedback often uses imagery and relaxation techniques; and most techniques modulate the breath to help elicit the relaxation response. Many studies examining the health benefits of mind-body interventions reflect this overlap, which can make validation of individual therapies more challenging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many other mind-body practices not discussed specifically here that can be beneficial to promoting health, decreasing side effects of cancer, and improving mood and quality of life. It can be an enjoyable and worthwhile endeavor to discover and try these practices. Many wellness centers, as well as a growing number of cancer centers, offer mind-body classes, groups sessions, or educational series. Some, such as Yoga, Qi Gong or Tai Chi, involve movement, while others focus on imagery, biofeedback, meditation or mindfulness. Most involve focused breathing.</p>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" \r\n\t\tborderFragment=\"pagesList\" category=\"CANTK_MINDBODY\" list_heading=\"Mind-Body Modalities\" />\r\n\r\n<!--p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/breathwork.html\">Breathwork &gt;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/guided_imagery.html\">Guided Imagery &gt; </a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/hypnosis.html\">Hypnosis &gt;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/meditation_mindfulness.html\">Mindfulness and Meditation &gt;</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/cancertoolkit/yoga.html\">Yoga &gt; </a></p-->\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\" heading=\"Background\" heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"21437197\"  /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"24590636\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "on", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "65084", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}},{"document_id":"TKC00021","name":"Green Tea","create_date":"2019-03-26","publish_date":"2019-03-26","related_docs":{},"categories":["Super Foods"],"content_json":{"body": "<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderfragment=\"htmlContent\">\r\n<h2>Green Tea</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Green tea comes from the plant <em>Camellia sinensis</em>, the same as black tea. The difference between black and green tea has to do with the harvesting and production process. Green tea is made from the fresher, unwilted tea leaves. Black tea leaves, on the other hand, are allowed to oxidize and wilt, which results in a darker color and different flavor. Tea is composed of several types of polyphenols called catechins. One type of catechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), is abundant in green tea and has been studied for its anti-cancer and general health benefits. Green tea has significantly higher amounts of EGGC than black tea. EGGC is a powerful antioxidant which can help prevent DNA damage, reduce tumor formation, and protect against cancer spread. EGCG has also been shown to stimulate the immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exact amount of green tea needed to enhance health and protect the body from cancer has not been determined. Most experts recommend between 2-6 cups of green tea daily. It is important to remember that green tea is caffeinated and is therefore not right for everybody. Individuals respond to caffeine differently. Please be mindful to reduce your tea intake later in the day if you find that the caffeine interferes with your sleep. Decaffeinated green tea is also available. One way to naturally decaffeinate green tea is in the brewing process. Caffeine is rapidly extracted from the dried green tea leaves into the tea water. This means that a first steeping of green tea for several minutes will extract the caffeine. You can then discard that tea and re-steep the same leaves. The catechins, including EGCG, will now be extracted without caffeine. You can re-steep the same dried green tea throughout the day to continually extract the medicinal catechins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that the temperature of the water for brewing green tea should be between 140 &ndash; 180 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent scorching or destroying beneficial properties.</p>\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"relatedResourcesList\"></ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n</ecs:dyna>\r\n\r\n<ecs:dyna name=\"contentBlock\" template=\"/templates/patientToolkit/toolkitFragments.html\" borderFragment=\"refCollapsible\"  heading=\"References\">\r\n\r\n<p><ecs:dyna type=\"Reference\" name=\"referenceEntry\" entryType=\"PUBMED\" entryId=\"Cheng2020\" hint=\"Cheng, 2020\" /></p>\r\n</ecs:dyna>", "panel": " ", "nav_panel": "false", "hide_image": "false", "main_image": "64226", "not_savable": "false", "image_caption": " ", "header_buttons": " "}}]
